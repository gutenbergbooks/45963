<p class="center">"A word spoken in due season, how good is it!"&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prov.</span> 15:23.</p>


<p class="mt2">"I'm to be dressed in white, mammy, with
blue sash and ribbons, papa says, and to go
back to him as soon as you are done with
me."</p>

<p>"Is you, honey? but co'se you is; you
mos' neber wears nuffin but white when de
warm days comes; an' massa can't do widout
his darlin' pet, now all de res' am gone."</p>

<p>"No; nor I without him," Elsie said,
tears springing to her eyes. "Oh, don't
these rooms seem lonely, mammy? Don't
you miss Annis?"</p>

<p>"Co'se, honey, co'se I dose; but tank
de Lord, I'se got my own darlin' chile lef'."</p>

<p>"And I have you and papa left," returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the little girl, smiling through her
tears, "and that's a great deal; papa alone is
more than half of all the world to me, and
you know I could never do without you,
mammy."</p>

<p>"Yo' ole mammy hopes you'll always
tink like dat, honey," said Chloe, taking out
the articles needed for the little girl's toilet.
"'Pears like ole times come back," she remarked
presently, combing a glossy ringlet
round her finger; "de ole times befo' we
went up Norf and massa got married to Miss
Rose."</p>

<p>"Yes; and oh, mammy, papa has said I
may be with him all day long, from the time
I'm up in the morning and dressed, till I
have to go to bed at night. Isn't it nice?"</p>

<p>"Berry nice plan, honey; 'spect it keep
bofe you and massa from feelin' mos' pow'ful
lonesome."</p>

<p>"Yes," Elsie said; "and I like it ever so
much for a little while, but I wouldn't for
anything be without mamma and Horace all
the time."</p>

<p>Aunt Chloe was still busy with the ringlets.
She took almost as much pride and delight
in their beauty and abundance as the
fond father himself, and was apt to linger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
lovingly over her task. But Elsie, though
wont to endure with exemplary patience and
resignation the somewhat tedious and trying
ordeal of combing and curling, never complaining,
though now and then compelled to
wince when the comb caught in a tangle and
mammy gave a pull that was far from pleasant,
would sometimes have been glad to have
them cut off would papa only have given consent.</p>

<p>"Dar, honey, dat job am done," Aunt
Chloe said at length, laying aside the comb
and brush. "Now fo' de dress and ribbons,
an' den you kin go back to massa."</p>

<p>"I want to just as soon as I can," said
the little girl.</p>

<p>"What goin' be done 'bout pourin' de tea
to-night?" asked Aunt Chloe presently, rather
as if thinking aloud than speaking to Elsie.</p>

<p>"Why," queried the little girl, "won't
Mrs. Murray do it as usual?"</p>

<p>"Dunno, chile, she hab pow'ful bad headache."</p>

<p>"Has she? How sorry I am! Oh, I
wonder if papa would let me try!"</p>

<p>"'Spect so, honey, ef you axes him," said
Aunt Chloe, giving a final adjustment to the
bows of the sash and the folds of the dress.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"So I will," cried the little girl, skipping
away. But the next instant, coming to a
sudden standstill and turning toward her
nurse a face full of concern, "Mammy," she
asked, "do you think I can do anything to
help poor Mrs. Murray's head?"</p>

<p>"No, chile, she ain't wantin' nuffin but
to be let 'lone till de sickness am gone."</p>

<p>"I wish I could help her," sighed Elsie,
in a tenderly pitying tone; "I'm very sorry
for her, but hope she will be well again to-morrow."</p>

<p>Two gentlemen were sitting in the veranda.
Each turned a smiling, affectionate look
upon the little girl as she stepped from the
open doorway, the one saying, "Well, daughter,"
the other, "How are you to-day, my
little friend?"</p>

<p>"Quite well, thank you, Mr. Travilla.
How are you, sir?" she said, putting her
small white hand into the larger, browner one
he held out to her.</p>

<p>He kept it for a minute or two while he
chatted with her about the cousins who had
just left for their Northern home, after spending
the winter as guests at the Oaks, and of
her mamma and baby brother, who were travelling
to Philadelphia in their company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say the house seems very quiet
and rather lonely?" he remarked, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; especially in my rooms," she
said, glancing round at her father, who was
silently listening to their talk; "but papa has
promised to let me be with him all the time
during the day. So I shall not mind it so
much."</p>

<p>"Was not that a rather rash promise,
Dinsmore?" asked Mr. Travilla, with mock
gravity. "Well, if you tire of her company
at any time, we of Ion shall be delighted to
have her sent to us."</p>

<p>"Thank you," Mr. Dinsmore said, with
a humorous look at his little girl; "I shall
certainly send her to you directly I tire of her
society."</p>

<p>Elsie glanced searchingly into his face;
then with a happy laugh ran to him, and putting
her arm about his neck, said, "I'm not
the least bit frightened, papa; not at all
afraid that you will want to be rid of me. I
hope I'm not quite so silly as I was once when
Mr. Travilla made me think you might give
me away to him."</p>

<p>"But it was only a loan I was asking for
this time, my little friend," was Mr. Travilla's
pleasant rejoinder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, sir; but if you borrow me you'll
have to borrow papa too for the same length
of time," Elsie said, with a merry laugh.
"Won't he, papa?"</p>

<p>"I think he cannot have you on any easier
terms," Mr. Dinsmore answered; "for I certainly
cannot spare you from home while I
stay here alone."</p>

<p>"A very satisfactory arrangement to me,
provided we are allowed to keep you both as
long as we wish," Mr. Travilla said, rising as
if to take leave.</p>

<p>But an urgent invitation to stay to tea induced
him to resume his seat.</p>

<p>Then Elsie preferred her request.</p>

<p>It was granted at once, her father saying,
with a pleased look, "I should like to see
how well you can fill your mamma's place;
and if you show yourself capable, you may do
so always in her absence, if you wish."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, papa," she cried in delight.
"I'll do my very best. But I'm glad
there are no strangers to tea to-night to see
me make my first attempt. You are a guest,
Mr. Travilla, but not a stranger," she added,
with a bright, winsome look up at him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," he said; "it
would be a grief of heart to me to be looked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
upon in that light by the little girl whose affection
I value so highly."</p>

<p>"You are very kind to say so, sir," she
returned, with a blush and a smile, "and I believe
I'm every bit as fond of you as if you
were my uncle. I have often heard papa say
you and he were like brothers, and that would
make you my uncle, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," her father said; "and so good
and kind an uncle would be something to be
thankful for, wouldn't it? Ah," rising and
taking her hand, "there is the tea-bell. Now
for your experiment. Will you walk out with
us, Travilla?"</p>

<p>Both gentlemen watched the little girl
with loving interest while she went through
the duties of her new position with a quiet
grace and dignity that filled her father with
proud delight, and increased the admiration
already felt for her by his friend.</p>

<p>On leaving the table they returned to the
veranda, where the gentlemen sat conversing,
with Elsie between them.</p>

<p>But presently Mr. Dinsmore, hearing
that some one from the quarter wished to
speak to him, left the other two alone for a
while.</p>

<p>"Elsie," Mr. Travilla said softly, taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the little girl's hand in his, "I have something
to tell you."</p>

<p>Her only reply was an inquiring look, and
he went on: "Something which I am sure
you will be glad to hear. But first let me ask
if you remember a talk we had together one
morning at Roselands, the first summer after
your father and I returned from Europe?"</p>

<p>"You were so kind as to talk to me a
good many times, sir," Elsie answered doubtfully.</p>

<p>"This was the morning after your fall
from the piano-stool. I found you in the
garden reading your Bible and crying over
it," he said. "And in the talk that followed
you expressed great concern at the discovery
that I had no love for the Lord Jesus Christ.
A text you quoted&mdash;'If any man love not the
Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema maranatha'&mdash;has
since come very frequently to my
recollection, and troubled my conscience not a
little."</p>

<p>Elsie was now listening with intense interest.
Mr. Travilla paused for a moment, his
face expressing deep emotion; then resumed:
"I think God's Holy Spirit has thoroughly
convinced me of the exceeding sinfulness
of unbelief; of refusing or neglecting His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
offered salvation through the atoning blood of
His dear Son; refusing to give to the Lord
Jesus the poor little return of the best love of
my heart for all He has done and suffered in
my stead. This is what I had to tell you, my
dear little friend. I have found Jesus&mdash;have
given myself unreservedly to Him, to be His
for time and for eternity, and I have been led
to do this mainly through your instrumentality."</p>

<p>Tears of joy filled the little girl's eyes.
"I am so glad, Mr. Travilla, so very glad!"
she exclaimed. "It is the best news I could
possibly have heard."</p>

<p>"Thank you, my dear," he said, with
feeling. "I can now understand your anxiety
for my conversion, for I myself am conscious
of a yearning desire for the salvation of souls,
especially of those of my friends and acquaintances."</p>

<p>"And now you will join the church,
won't you, sir?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Elsie; that is a question
of duty I have not yet decided. There are so
many of its members who are a disgrace to
their profession, that I fear I might prove so
also. What do you think about it?"</p>

<p>"I'm only a little child, not half so wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
as you are, sir," she answered, with unaffected
modesty.</p>

<p>"Still, I should like to hear your opinion."</p>

<p>After a moment's hesitation and silent
thought she lifted a very earnest face to his.
"God tells us that He is able to keep us from
falling. And don't you think, Mr. Travilla,
that it's what the Bible says we should be
guided by, and not what somebody else
thinks?"</p>

<p>"Yes; that is quite true."</p>

<p>"'To the law and to the testimony: if
they speak not according to this word, it is because
there is no light in them,'" she quoted.</p>

<p>"You have studied the Bible so much
longer than I," he said, "can you tell me
where to look for its directions in regard to
this matter? Does it really give any?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; oh, yes! Is not joining the
church confessing Christ before men, owning
Him as our Master, our Lord, our God?"</p>

<p>He nodded assent.</p>

<p>Elsie called to a servant lounging near,
and sent him for her Bible.</p>

<p>"Can you find the texts you want without
a concordance?" Mr. Travilla asked, regarding
her with interest as she took the book and
opened it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think I can," she answered, turning
over the leaves; "I have read them so often.
Yes, here&mdash;Matt. 10:32, 33&mdash;is one: 'Whosoever
therefore shall confess me before men,
him will I confess also before my Father which
is in heaven. But whosoever shall deny me
before men, him will I also deny before my
Father which is in heaven.'"</p>

<p>She gave him a questioning, pleading look.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a subdued tone, "I
think that is to the point; at least, if we grant
that joining the church is the only way of
confessing Christ."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you see? Don't you think,
Mr. Travilla, that if we love Him with all
our hearts we will want to confess Him everywhere
and in every way that we can? Won't
we want everybody to know that we belong to
Him, and own Him as our Master, our Lord,
our King?" she exclaimed with eager enthusiasm,
her voice taking a tone of earnest entreaty.</p>

<p>"I believe you are right," he said; "that
would be the natural effect of such love as we
ought to feel&mdash;as I am sure you do feel for
Him."</p>

<p>"I do love Him, but not half so much as
I ought," she answered with a sigh, as again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
she turned over the leaves of her Bible. "I
often wonder how it is that my love to Him
is so cold compared to His for me. It is as
though I gave Him but one little drop in return
for a mighty ocean." A tear fell on the
page as she spoke.</p>

<p>Then again she read: "'The gift of God
is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.'
'The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth
and in thy heart'&mdash;that is, the word of faith
which we preach; 'that if thou shalt confess
with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe
in thine heart that God hath <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'aised'">raised</ins> Him
from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For
with the heart man believeth unto righteousness;
and with the mouth confession is made
unto salvation.'"</p>

<p>Looking up at him, "Oh, Mr. Travilla,"
she said, "shall we refuse to be soldiers at all
because there are some traitors in the army?
Isn't there all the more need of brave, true
men for that very reason? plenty of them to
fight the Lord's battles and conquer His enemies?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but cannot one do that without
becoming a member of a church?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't that be a queer kind of an
army where there was no concert of action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
but every man fought separately in the way
that seemed best to himself?" she asked,
with modest hesitation. "I've read about the
armies and battles of our Revolution and
other wars, and I don't remember that there
was ever a great victory except where a good
many men were joined under one leader."</p>

<p>"Very true," he replied, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"And if you love Jesus, Mr. Travilla,
how can you help wanting to obey His dying
command, 'Do this in remembrance of me'?
And that we cannot do unless we are members
of some church."</p>

<p>"I should not hesitate, Elsie, if I were
but sure of being able to hold out, and not
disgrace my profession," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore returned to the veranda and
sat down again by Elsie's side, just in time to
hear his friend's last sentence.</p>

<p>"It is a profession of religion you are
speaking of, I presume," he said, half inquiringly.
"Well, Travilla, we must be content
to take one step at a time as we follow our
Leader; to put on the armor and go into battle
trusting in the Captain of our salvation to
lead us on to final victory. He bids us 'fear
not; I will help thee.' 'As thy days, so shall
thy strength be.' 'He keepeth the feet of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
His saints.' 'Who shall separate us from the
love of Christ?... We are more than conquerors
through Him that loved us. For I
am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor
angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be
able to separate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jesus our Lord,' for His
chosen, His redeemed ones are kept by the
power of God through faith unto salvation.

<p class="center">"This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither

<p class="mt2">Mr. Travilla had gone, and Mr. Dinsmore
and his little daughter sat alone upon
the veranda; she upon his knee, his arm
about her waist. Some moments had passed
without a word spoken by either. Elsie's
eyes were downcast, her face full of solemn
joy.</p>

<p>"What is my little girl thinking of?" her
father asked at length.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, I am so glad, so happy, so
thankful!" she said; and as she looked up
into his face he saw that tears were glistening
in her eyes.</p>

<p>"You are seldom other than happy, I
think and hope," he responded, softly stroking
her hair.</p>

<p>"Yes, very seldom, dear papa. How
could anybody be unhappy with so many,
many blessings to be thankful for, especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
such a dear, kind father to love and take care
of me? But I am happier than usual to-night
because of the good news Mr. Travilla
has told me."</p>

<p>"Ah, what was that?"</p>

<p>"That he has found the Saviour, papa,
and that it was partly through my instrumentality.
Isn't it strange that God should have
so honored a child like me?"</p>

<p>"Ah, I don't know that it is. 'A little
child shall lead them,' the Bible says. 'Out
of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast
perfected praise.' God often works by the
feeblest instrumentality, that thus all may
see that the glory is due to Him alone. I rejoice
with you, my darling, for no greater
blessing can be ours than that of being permitted
to win souls to Christ."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa; but I am so far from being
what I ought," she added, with unaffected
humility, "that I wonder I have not proved
a stumbling-block instead of a help."</p>

<p>"Give the glory to God," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, I know it all belongs to
Him. Oh, don't you hope Mr. Travilla will
be with us next Sabbath?"</p>

<p>"At the Lord's table? I do indeed. It
is a precious privilege I have long wished to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
share with him; a means of grace no Christian
ought ever to neglect; a command that
as the last and dying one of our blessed Master
we should joyfully obey whenever opportunity
is afforded us, yet with the utmost endeavor
to be in a proper frame of mind; for
'he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth
and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning
the Lord's body.' It is a dreadful sin
for any one to sit down to that table without
having examined himself of his knowledge to
discern the Lord's body, of his faith to feed
upon Him, repentance, love, and new obedience.
Let us both pray earnestly for grace
and help to partake worthily, repenting of
every sin, hating and forsaking it, and devoting
ourselves anew and unreservedly to the
Master's service."</p>

<p>"I will, papa," she said. "And should
we not meditate on Jesus while at His table?"</p>

<p>"Yes, He should be the principal theme
of our thoughts all through the exercises; we
should remember Him&mdash;the loveliness of His
character, the life He led, the death He died,
and all that He has done and suffered for us."</p>

<p>They fell into silent thought again. Elsie
was the first to speak. "I wonder where
they are now, papa?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who, our travellers? Well, we cannot
tell precisely; but I hope it will not be very
long before we shall hear of their safe arrival
in Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"That will end the journey for mamma
and Horace," she remarked; "but what a
long one the others will still have before
them! I should think Annis would feel as if
she must hurry on as fast as possible till she
gets home to her father and mother."</p>

<p>"Very possibly she may; but I know that
Dr. Landreth and Mildred intend resting for
some days in Philadelphia. So Annis will be
obliged to curb her impatience, which the
sights of the city will no doubt help her to
do."</p>

<p>At that instant Elsie gave a sudden start,
asking in an awed, tremulous whisper, "Papa,
what is that?" nestling closer to him as she
spoke.</p>

<p>It was growing dusk, and a shadowy figure,
dimly seen by the waning light, had just
emerged from the shadow of a large tree at
some distance down the drive. It was now
stealing cautiously in their direction.</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, dearest," Mr. Dinsmore
said, tightening his clasp of Elsie's slight
form; "I presume it is some runaway whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
hunger has forced to show himself." Then
calling to the figure which continued to advance
with slow, faltering steps, "Halt!
Who are you, and what is your business
here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I'se Zeke, massa," answered a trembling
voice; "I'se come back to wuk, an' hopes
you won't be hawd on a po' niggah wha's repentin'
an' pow'ful sorry fo' takin' a holiday
widout yo' leave, sah." Mr. Dinsmore made
no reply, and the man drew nearer. "I'se
pow'ful sorry, massa," he repeated, pausing
at the foot of the veranda steps, and standing
there in a cringing attitude, his rags fluttering
in the evening breeze, the remnant of a
straw hat in his hand; "hope you won't order
me no floggin'."</p>

<p>"If you choose to go back where you
came from, I shall not interfere with you,
Zeke," returned Mr. Dinsmore, coolly.</p>

<p>"I'se done tired o' de swamp, sah; I'se
like to starve to deff dar; hain't tasted not de
fust mawsel o' victuals fo' de las' two days."</p>

<p>"Oh, poor fellow, how hungry he must
be!" exclaimed Elsie. "Papa, won't you
please give him something to eat?"</p>

<p>"He won't work, Elsie; since I have
known him he has never earned his salt."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, papa," she pleaded, "wouldn't it
be wrong and cruel to let him starve while we
have plenty and to spare?"</p>

<p>"Would it? God's command is, 'Six
days shalt thou labor and do all thy work.'
And Paul says to the Thessalonians, 'Even
when we were with you, this we commanded
you, that if any would not work, neither
should he eat.'"</p>

<p>Elsie turned to the suppliant. "Zeke,
you hear what the Bible says, and you know
we must all obey its teachings."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Elsie, dat's true nuff."</p>

<p>"Then will you promise papa that if he
feeds you now you will go to work industriously
to-morrow, if God spares your life?"</p>

<p>"Sho'n I will, Miss Elsie, 'cept I gets de
misery in de back, or de head, or somewheres
else."</p>

<p>"He can always find a hole to creep out
at, Elsie," Mr. Dinsmore said, with a slight
laugh; "those miseries never elude a determined
search."</p>

<p>"But, Zeke," said Elsie, "you mustn't
give up for a little misery; you mustn't try
to feel one."</p>

<p>"Sho' not; but dey jes' comes dere-selves,
little missy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"And some people give them every encouragement,
while others work on in spite of
them," remarked his master, with some sternness
of tone. "I assure you, Zeke, that I
have myself done many an hour's work while
enduring a racking headache."</p>

<p>"You, sah? T'ought you didn't never
do no wuk."</p>

<p>"Just because you never saw me take
hold of spade or hoe? One may toil far
harder with the mind, Zeke. Well, I will
give you one more trial. Go to the kitchen
and tell Aunt Dinah, from me, that she is to
give you something to eat; and to-morrow
you must go to work with the rest in the field
or&mdash;starve. And mind, if you have been
without food as long as you say, you mustn't
eat nearly so much as you want to-night, or
you'll kill yourself."</p>

<p>"Tank you, sah, I 'cepts de conditions;"
and with a low bow, first to Mr. Dinsmore,
then to Elsie, he turned and shambled off in
the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Papa, is he so very lazy?" asked Elsie.</p>

<p>"Very; he would do nothing but lie in
the sun if allowed to follow his own pleasure,
though he is young, strong, and healthy. He
disappeared some days ago, but I permitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
no search to be made for him, and should
have been better pleased had I never seen
him again."</p>

<p>"Papa, perhaps he might do better at
some other work; in the garden or about the
stables."</p>

<p>"Possibly. I think I shall try acting
upon your suggestion."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, sir," she said. Then
after a moment's thoughtful silence: "Papa,
we are sitting here doing nothing at all; yet
I know you must think it right, else you
wouldn't do it, or let me."</p>

<p>"It is right: neither body nor mind was
made capable of incessant exertion; we need
intervals of rest, and can accomplish more in
the end by taking them when needed. Jesus
once said to His disciples, 'Come ye yourselves
apart into a desert place, and rest a
while.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes! I remember it now," she
said. "How good and kind, how thoughtful
for others, He always was! Papa, I do so
want to be like Him."</p>

<p>"I think you are, my darling," he answered
in moved tones, and pressing her closer
to him; "like Him in sufficient measure for
those who know you in your daily life to 'take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
knowledge of you that you have been with
Jesus' and learned of Him."</p>

<p>"Papa, you couldn't say sweeter words to
me," she whispered, with her arm about his
neck; and he felt a tear fall on his cheek.
"And you, papa; oh, I am sure no one could
be long in your company without feeling sure
you were one of Jesus' disciples."</p>

<p>"I hope that is so," he said with feeling;
"for, like you, I most earnestly desire to
honor Him by my daily walk and conversation,
and to be always and everywhere recognized
as His servant."</p>

<p>Elsie, who had the kindest of hearts,
thought of Zeke while her mammy was preparing
her for bed that night, and again while
going through the duties of her morning
toilet. That completed, she hastened to her
father with a request that Zeke might be set
to work in her own little garden.</p>

<p>"Weeding and watering it would be very
pleasant, easy work, I am sure," she added.
"I like to do it myself."</p>

<p>"I doubt if Zeke would know weeds from
flowers," her father said, smiling down into
the eager little face.</p>

<p>"But I will show him, papa, if I may."</p>

<p>"You may do just as you please about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
it," was the indulgent reply. "We will
have our reading and prayer together, and
then you may send for Zeke, and give him his
instructions."</p>

<p>"Oh, thank you, papa!" she exclaimed,
with as sincere joy and gratitude as though
she had won some great favor for herself.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore rang for a servant, and sent
a message to Zeke. He was directed to make
himself clean and decent, and come to the
veranda for further orders.</p>

<p>He obeyed. Elsie found him waiting
there, and taking him to her garden explained
minutely what she wished him to do,
calling his attention particularly to the difference
between the leaves of the weeds that
were to be uprooted and those of some annuals
not yet in bloom.</p>

<p>He promised faithfully to attend to her
directions and to be industrious.</p>

<p>"Don't you think it's nicer, easier work
than what you would have had to do in the
field?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Ya-as, Miss Elsie," he drawled, "but
it's stoopin' all de same, and I'se got de misery
in de back."</p>

<p>She gave him a searching look, then said
reproachfully, "O Zeke, you don't look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
the least bit sick, and I can't help being afraid
you are really lazy. Remember God knows
all about it, and is very much displeased with
you, if you are not speaking the truth."</p>

<p>"Sho I'se gwine to wuk anyhow, honey,"
he answered, with a sound between a sigh
and a groan, as he bent down and pulled up a
weed.</p>

<p>"That's right," she said pleasantly, as she
turned and left him.</p>

<p>An hour later, coming out to see what
progress he was making, she found nearly all
her beloved annuals plucked up by the roots,
and lying withering among the weeds in the
scorching sun.</p>

<p>"Oh, how could you, Zeke!" she cried,
her eyes filling with tears.</p>

<p>"Why, what's de mattah, Miss Elsie?"
he asked, gaping at her in open-mouthed
wonder, not unmixed with apprehension and
dismay.</p>

<p>"Matter? You have been pulling up
flowers as well as weeds. That is one you
have in your fingers now."</p>

<p>Zeke dropped it as if it had been a hot
coal, and stood staring at it where it lay wilting
on the hot ground. "Sho, Miss Elsie, I
didn't go fo' to do no sech t'ing," he said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
plaintively; "t'ought I was doin' 'bout
right. Shall I plant 'em agin?"</p>

<p>"No; they wouldn't grow," she said.</p>

<p>"Dis niggah's mighty sorry, Miss Elsie.
You ain't gwine to hab him sent back to de
wuk in de field, is you?" he asked, with
humble entreaty.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that is all you are fit for,
Zeke; but the decision rests with papa. I
will go and speak to him about it. Don't try
to do any more work here, lest you do more
mischief," she said, turning toward the house.</p>

<p>He hurried after her. "Please now, Miss
Elsie, don' go for to 'suade massa agin dis po'
niggah."</p>

<p>"No, I shall not," she answered kindly;
"perhaps there is something else you can be
set at about the house or grounds. But,
Zeke," turning to him and speaking very
earnestly, "you will never succeed at anything
unless you strive against your natural
laziness, and try to do your best. That is
what God bids us all do. He says, 'Whatsoever
thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy
might.' 'Whatsoever ye do, do it heartily,
as to the Lord and not unto men.'"</p>

<p>"S'pect dat's so, Miss Elsie," he drawled;
"but de Lawd He ain't gwine to take no notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
what a po' niggah's 'bout in de field or de
garden."</p>

<p>"That's a great mistake, Zeke," she said.
"His eye is always on you&mdash;on everybody;
and He is pleased with us if He sees us trying
to do faithfully the work He has given us, no
matter how low the task may seem to us or
other human creatures, and displeased if we
are not trying to do it 'as to the Lord and not
unto men.'"</p>

<p>"You ain't 'fended 'bout dose po' flowahs
what dis po' niggah bin pull up in a mistake,
is you now, Miss Elsie?" he asked.</p>

<p>Evidently her religious teachings had made
no more impression than the idle whistling of
the wind.</p>

<p>"No, Zeke, I only can't trust you again,"
she said, turning away with a slight sigh over
her failure to win him from his inborn indolence.</p>

<p>She hastened to her father with the story
of what had occurred.</p>

<p>"Ah! it is about what I had expected,"
he said. "I am sorry for your loss, but it
can soon be repaired. Have you left Zeke
there to finish the work of destruction?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I told him to stop till he heard
from you."</p>

<p>"He shall go back to the field at once;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
there is no propriety in giving him an opportunity
to do further mischief," Mr. Dinsmore
said, with a decision that left no room for remonstrance;
and summoning a servant sent
the order.</p>

<p>Elsie heard it with a sigh. "What now?
You are not wasting pity on that incorrigibly
lazy wretch?" her father asked, drawing her
caressingly to his knee.</p>

<p>"I did hope to do him some good, papa,"
she sighed, "and I'm disappointed that I
can't."</p>

<p>"There may be other opportunities in the
future," he said. "And do not fret about
the flowers. You are welcome to claim all in
my gardens and conservatories."</p>

<p>"How good and generous you always are
to me, you dear father!" she said, thanking
him with a hug and kiss, while her face grew
bright with love and happiness. "No, I
won't fret; how wicked it would be for one
who has so many blessings! But, papa, I
can't help feeling sorry for the little tender
plants, plucked up so rudely by the roots and
left to perish in the broiling sun. They were
live things, and it seems as if they must
have felt it all, and suffered almost as an insect
or an animal would."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>Her father smiled, and smoothed her hair
with softly caressing hand. "My little girl
has a very tender heart, and is full of loving
sympathy for all living things," he said.
"Ah, Travilla. Glad to see you!" as at that
instant that gentleman galloped up and dismounted.</p>

<p>"So am I, sir," Elsie said, leaving her
father's knee to run with outstretched hand
to meet and welcome their guest.</p>

<p>He clasped the little hand in his, and held
it for a moment, while he bent down and
kissed the sweet lips of its owner. "What
news?" Mr. Dinsmore asked, when he had
given his friend a seat and resumed his own.</p>

<p>"None that I know of, except that I have
come to your view (which is my mother's
also) of the subject we were discussing yesterday,
and have decided to act accordingly,"
Mr. Travilla answered, with a rarely sweet
smile directed to little Elsie.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, her face growing radiant,
"I am so glad, so very glad!"</p>

<p>"And I, too," said her father. "I am
sure you will never regret having come out
boldly on the Lord's side."</p>

<p>"No; my only regret will be that I delayed
so long enrolling myself among His professed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
followers. I now feel an ardent desire
to be known and recognized as His servant,
and am ready to go forward, trusting implicitly
His many great and precious promises to
help me all my journey through."</p>

<p>"'Being confident of this very thing, that
He which hath begun a good work in you will
perform it until the day of Jesus Christ'?"
quoted Mr. Dinsmore inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Travilla, "for He is
able to keep that which I have committed unto
Him; able to keep even me from falling."</p>

<small>AUNT WEALTHY.</small></h2>


<p class="mt2">Dr. Landreth and his party reached Philadelphia
in due season, arriving in health and
safety, having met with no accident or loss
by the way.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dinsmore found her father and the
family carriage waiting for her and her baby
boy at the depot.</p>

<p>The others took a hack and drove to the
Girard House, where Miss Stanhope, who had
been visiting friends in the neighborhood of
the city, had appointed to meet them, that
they and she might journey westward in company.
She was there waiting for them in a
private parlor.</p>

<p>The meeting was a joyful one to the two
ladies, who, though always warmly attached,
had now been separated for a number of
years. They clasped each other in a long,
tender embrace; then Mildred introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
her husband, and exhibited her baby with
much pride and delight; Annis, too, for she
had quite grown out of Aunt Wealthy's recollection,
and had scarce any remembrance of
the old lady, except from hearing her spoken
of by the other members of the family.</p>

<p>The travellers were weary with their journey,
and there was much to hear and tell; so
the remainder of that day was given up to
rest and talk, a part of the latter being on the
arrangement of their plans. Mildred proposed
that they should take a week or more
for rest and shopping, then turn their faces
homeward.</p>

<p>"You must allow some time for sight-seeing,
my dear," said her husband. "It would
be a great shame to carry Annis all the way
out to Indiana again without having shown
her the lions of Philadelphia."</p>

<p>"Oh, certainly she must see them," said
Mildred. "You can show them to her while
Aunt Wealthy and I are shopping."</p>

<p>"You intend, then, to shut me out of
that business? How shall I know that you
will not be ruining me?"</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mildred, laughing, "you
forget how rich you have made me. I shall
have no occasion to ruin anybody but myself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>"And as for me," remarked Miss Stanhope
drily, "I have my own purse."</p>

<p>"And father has sent money to buy Ada's
things, mother's, and Fan's, too," added
Annis. "But, Milly, I must have some
share in the shopping, too. I expect to enjoy
that as much as the sight-seeing."</p>

<p>Mildred assured her she should have as
much as she wanted, adding, "But there will
be a good deal which will not be likely to interest
you&mdash;napery and other housekeeping
goods, for instance."</p>

<p>"Your share of those things will interest
me, and must be paid for from my purse,"
put in the doctor.</p>

<p>"Quite a mistake," said Miss Stanhope;
"those are the very things a bride or her
parents are expected to supply."</p>

<p>"But Mildred is no longer a bride. Milly,
my dear, I want you to help me to select a
dress for the bride that is to be."</p>

<p>Mildred looked up with a pleased smile.
"Just like you, Charlie; always thoughtful
and generous!"</p>

<p>Ada Keith was the coming bride. She
and Frank Osborne had been engaged for
some weeks, and expected to marry in the fall.
This news had increased Annis's desire to get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
home. She wanted, she said, to see how Mr.
Osborne and Ada acted, and whether they
looked very happy.</p>

<p>"And just to think," she added, "when
they're married Fan will be Miss Keith, and
we two will be the young ladies of the
family."</p>

<p>"Ah, indeed! How old may you be, my
little maid?" laughed the doctor.</p>

<p>"Most thirteen," returned the little girl,
drawing herself up with an air of importance.</p>

<p>"A very young young lady, most decidedly,"
he said with a humorous look, bending
down to pinch her rosy cheek as he spoke.</p>

<p>"I'm growing older every day," she answered
demurely, edging away from him.
"Father told me a year ago that I'd soon be
a woman."</p>

<p>"Quite soon enough, dear; don't try to
hurry matters," said Aunt Wealthy. "You
can never be a little girl again."</p>

<p>Mildred, having brought a competent nurse
with her thus far on her journey, a colored
woman who would serve her in the care of
little Percy while they remained in Philadelphia,
then return to the South with Mrs.
Dinsmore, was able to give herself to the
shopping without distraction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>As she had foreseen, the greater part of
that work fell to her and Miss Stanhope, Dr.
Landreth and Annis accompanying them constantly
for a day or two only, after that for an
hour or so when something was to be purchased
in which they were specially interested.</p>

<p>But the two ladies were equal to the demand
upon them; Mildred had had a good
deal of experience in shopping in the last few
years, and Miss Stanhope was a veteran at the
business&mdash;an excellent judge of qualities and
prices&mdash;yet by reason of her absent-mindedness
needed to have her knowledge supplemented
by the collected wits of her niece.</p>

<p>The old lady's odd ways and speeches
often caused no little amusement to all within
sight and hearing.</p>

<p>One day she, her two nieces, and Dr. Landreth
were in a large, handsomely appointed
dry-goods store, looking at silks and other
costly dress fabrics.</p>

<p>They had made several selections, and
while the doctor and Mildred paid for and saw
the goods cut off and put up, Miss Stanhope
moved on to the farther end of the room,
where she saw, as she thought, an open doorway
leading into another of similar dimensions
and appearance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>As she attempted to pass through the
doorway she found herself confronted by a
little old lady rather plainly attired. Miss
Stanhope nodded pleasantly, and stepped to
the right. At the same instant her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vis-à-vis</i>
nodded also, and stepped to her left, so that
they were still in each other's way. Miss
Stanhope moved quickly to the other side, but
the stranger doing likewise, they did not succeed
in passing. Miss Stanhope stood still,
so did the other, and for an instant they gazed
steadily into each other's eyes.</p>

<p>Then Miss Stanhope spoke in a gentle,
ladylike, yet slightly impatient tone: "I
should like to go on into that part of the
store, if you will kindly permit me. Take
whichever side you will; or, if you please,
stand where you are and let me step past
you."</p>

<p>She attempted to do so, but again the
stranger moved directly in front of her.</p>

<p>"Madam," said Miss Stanhope, unconsciously
raising her voice slightly, "I will
stand still if you will be good enough to step
out of my way."</p>

<p>There was neither reply nor movement,
but Miss Stanhope's ear caught sounds of
suppressed laughter coming from various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
directions in her rear, and a clerk, stepping to
her side, said, with an unsuccessful attempt
to preserve gravity of countenance and steadiness
of tone, "Excuse me, madam, but you
are standing before a mirror. There is no
doorway there."</p>

<p>"Dear me! so I am! What an old simpleton
not to recognize my own face!" she
exclaimed, joining good-naturedly in the
laugh her mistake had raised.</p>

<p>"Very good evidence that you are lacking
in the vanity that leads some to a frequent
contemplation of their own features,"
remarked the proprietor politely.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, an old woman like me has small
temptation to that," she returned.</p>

<p>"What was it, Aunt Wealthy? What
are you all laughing at?" asked Annis, joining
her.</p>

<p>"Just at a foolish mistake of your old
auntie's, my dear, taking a mirror for an open
doorway, and her own reflection for another
woman who wouldn't get out of her way."</p>

<p>Annis could not help laughing a little,
though she tried not to, lest she should hurt
the dear old lady's feelings.</p>

<p>"I'm not much surprised, auntie," she
said, gazing into the mirror, "for it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
seem like looking into another store. I think
I might have made that mistake myself; but
I never could have taken you for anybody
else, and it's odd you didn't know yourself."</p>

<p>"Ah, dearie, self-knowledge is said to be
the most rare and difficult thing in the world,"
returned Miss Stanhope pleasantly. "But
come, I see the doctor and Milly are waiting
for us."</p>

<p>"We are going to some trimming stores
now, Aunt Wealthy," said Mildred, "and
you will be able to match your zephyrs, I
hope."</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll have my samples out ready to
show," the old lady answered, taking them
from a small satchel which she carried upon
her arm. "You and the doctor walk on.
Annis and I will follow. Take tight hold of
my arm, dearie," she added, holding it out as
they stepped into the street, "lest you should
get separated from me and lost in the crowd&mdash;the
streets are so full, and everybody seems
in the greatest hurry."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Annis, doing as she was bidden,
"so different from Pleasant Plains;
there one can hurry along or not as one likes
without being jostled. There! Milly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
Brother Charlie have gone into a store, and
we must follow."</p>

<p>They hastened in, almost out of breath
from their rapid walk. Miss Stanhope gently
shook off Annis's hand, stepped to a counter,
holding out her samples of zephyr, and addressing
a clerk, remarked, "These are lovely
colors!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the girl, staring; "but what
of it, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"My aunt wishes to match them," said
Annis with dignity, resenting the half-insolent
tone of the girl.</p>

<p>"Oh! go to the next counter."</p>

<p>They moved on, Miss Stanhope smiling
to herself at her own mistake, Annis with
cheeks burning with indignation at the girl's
rude stare and supercilious tone.</p>

<p>"Don't forget what you want this time,
auntie," she whispered, as they paused before
the next counter.</p>

<p>"No, dearie, but you mustn't mind your
old auntie's blunders."</p>

<p>This time they were waited upon by a
sweet-faced, modest maiden, who showed herself
both obliging and respectful.</p>

<p>Miss Stanhope found just what she wanted.
But Mildred was not ready to go yet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and while waiting for her the old lady and
the little girl amused themselves in examining
the various contents of a showcase. Annis
admired a necklace of amber beads, and Aunt
Wealthy bought it for her; also another
nearly like it for Fan.</p>

<p>"Anything else, ma' am?" asked the saleswoman,
as she wrapped them up.</p>

<p>"Yes; one of those little purses," said
Miss Stanhope; "it is just what I want for
small change and the trunk of my key, which
I always carry in my pocket when travelling."</p>

<p>With a slight smile the saleswoman handed
out several.</p>

<p>Miss Stanhope made her selection, and the
query, "Anything else?" was repeated.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" exclaimed the old lady, as
with sudden recollection; "have you any remnants?"</p>

<p>"Remnants? of what?"</p>

<p>"Dress goods."</p>

<p>"Oh, no; we keep nothing but trimmings
and notions."</p>

<p>Mildred had finished her purchases, and
coming up at that moment, asked, "What is
it, Aunt Wealthy?"</p>

<p>"Remnants."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, yes; of course you will want a supply
of them," returned Mildred, with a good-humored,
slightly amused smile; "and yet
what use can you make of them now? Even
Annis has grown too large for a remnant to
make her a dress."</p>

<p>"But there's Percy, and Zillah's boy,
too," was the prompt reply; "besides, they
can be put to many uses about a house."</p>

<p>"Mightn't a remnant be big enough to
make an apron for a lady even?" asked
Annis.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mildred; "and as I know
auntie enjoys buying them, we will look for
some."</p>

<p>They started at once on the quest, and
Miss Stanhope was quite elated and triumphant
on finding, in two different stores, two
remnants of beautiful lawn, exactly alike,
which together would make an ample dress
pattern for Annis, besides others that could
be utilized for aprons for her and Fan, dresses
for the baby boys, or patchwork for quilts.
Remnants were quite a hobby with the old
lady, and she could never feel quite satisfied
with the results of a shopping expedition that
did not include some bargains in that line.</p>

<p>Returning to their hotel they found letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
from the Oaks and from home awaiting
them.</p>

<p>"Ah, Milly," remarked the doctor, with
satisfaction, as he glanced over his, "here are
our measures. Rupert sends them."</p>

<p>"Then they are sure to be right," she responded.</p>

<p>"Measures for what?" inquired Miss
Stanhope.</p>

<p>"Wall paper and carpets for our new
house; it is ready for them."</p>

<p>"Oh, how nice!" cried Annis, clapping
her hands. "May I go with you to choose
them, Brother Charlie?"</p>

<p>"We will be pleased to have your company
and the benefit of your taste," was the
gallant rejoinder, "Aunt Wealthy's also."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Miss Stanhope, absently.
"I'm glad you're so near being done
with your house, and I think it's a good plan
to buy your paper here; but I'm afraid you'll
have to put it on yourselves; for though
I remember there were some painterers in
Pleasant Plains when I was there, I don't
think there were any papers at all, and
everybody's walls were whitewashed, as far as
I can recollect."</p>

<p>"But you know that was some years ago,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
auntie," said Mildred, "and a good many
luxuries have been introduced since then,
paper-hangers among the rest."</p>

<p>"And the Keith family are so handy that
they can easily do such work for themselves,
if necessary," laughed Annis. "The boys
really did paper our house, and paint it, too.
Do you see, Milly," holding up a letter,
"this is from Elsie. She says she is having a
lovely time all alone with her papa, but misses
us ever so much, and hopes we will come
back to spend next winter at the Oaks."</p>

<p>"Tell her, when you write, that we are
greatly obliged, but the journey is quite too
long to take twice a year," returned Mildred
gayly.</p>

<p>"And we couldn't spend every winter
away from father and mother," added Annis.
"Oh, how glad I shall be to get home to
them, and Fan, and the rest! How soon can
we start?"</p>

<p>"Time's up in another week," answered
the doctor, "and I judge, by the rate at
which we've been going through the shopping
and sight-seeing, that we'll be ready by then."</p></div>

<p>A beautiful spring day was drawing to a
close as two persons&mdash;a young man and a
maiden&mdash;seated themselves on a fallen tree on
the western bank of the St. Joseph River.
They had strolled a long distance from home,
leaving the noise and bustle of the town far
behind. They were a trifle weary with their
walk, and it was pleasant to sit here and rest
in the cool evening air, sweet with the scent
of wildwood flowers, with the grass green
about their feet, and no sound to break the
stillness save the song of the cricket, the gentle
murmur of the breeze in the tree-tops, and
the soft ripple of the water flowing swiftly
onward, so bright and clear that it reflected, as
in a mirror, its own grassy wooded banks and
the rich purple, gold, and amber of the sunset
clouds, while the pebbly bottom, with fishes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
great and small darting hither and thither,
could be distinctly seen.</p>

<p>For some time the two sat there silently,
hand in hand, the girl's eyes gazing steadily
down into the water, her companion's fixed
upon her face with an expression of ardent
admiration and intense, yearning affection.
It was a noble countenance, at this moment
thoughtful and grave, even to sadness.</p>

<p>"Ada, my love," he said at length, "it
is a hard thing I am asking of you. I am
ashamed of my selfishness."</p>

<p>"No, no! do not talk so. How could I
bear to let you go alone, you who have no one
in the wide world but me?" she answered, in
a low, tremulous tone, her eyes still upon the
water; then suddenly turning toward him,
her face flushing with enthusiasm, her eyes
shining through tears, "But it is not you that
ask it of me, Frank; no, not you, but One
who has every right; for has He not redeemed
me with His own precious blood? Is
He not my Creator, Preserver, and bountiful
Benefactor, and have I not given myself
to Him, soul and body, in an everlasting
covenant? And shall I keep back any part
of the price? Oh, no, no! Let me but
make sure that it is His voice I hear saying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
'This is the way; walk ye in it,' and I am
ready to leave all and follow Him, though it
be to the ends of the earth."</p>

<p>"My darling," he said with emotion,
tightening his clasp of the hand he held,
"you have the right spirit; you view this
matter in the right light. Yes, we are His,
both of us, and may our only question of duty
ever be, 'Lord, what wilt thou have me to
do?' But if we see it our duty to go, the
sacrifice I make will be as nothing to yours,
my sweet girl."</p>

<p>"Yet it will not be small, Frank. To
leave forever one's dear native land is no
slight thing, especially when it is to live
among heathen people&mdash;low, cruel, degraded
idolators."</p>

<p>"That is true; and yet&mdash;oh, is there not
joy in the thought of telling the old, old story
of Jesus and His love to those who have never
heard it, and who, if we do not carry it to
them, may never hear it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, indeed! and in the thought
that we are literally obeying His command,
'Go ye into all the world and preach the
Gospel to every creature.' And how very
slight will be our suffering and self-denial
compared to His!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, Frank, how shall we determine this
question? How know whether we are truly
called to this great work? Ah, it does not
seem possible that I should ever be deemed
worthy of such honor!"</p>

<p>"We will continue to make it a subject of
constant, earnest prayer," he said, "asking
to be guided to a right decision; also we will
open our hearts to your parents, and consult
them. If they refuse consent to your going,
we will see in that an indication that the
Lord's will is not that we should go. Laborers
are needed here also, and it may be that
He will appoint us our work in this part of
His vineyard."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said; "I could never feel it
right to go if father and mother should oppose
it. Yet I am sure they will not, if they see
reason to believe we are called of the Master;
for ever since I can remember their most
ardent wish for their children has been that
they might be entirely devoted to His service."</p>

<p>At that very moment the honored parents
of whom she spoke, sitting side by side in the
vine-covered porch of their home, resting
after the labors of the day, were talking of
their children, and rejoicing in the well-founded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
belief that most, if not all, of them
had already given themselves to that blessed
service.</p>

<p>They spoke of Mildred and Annis, the
eldest and youngest, now on the way home
after their winter at the Oaks; of Rupert,
their eldest son, a prosperous and highly respected
man of business; Cyril, absent at college;
Zillah, with her husband and babe, living
just across the street; of Ada and her betrothed;
and, lastly, of the only two just then
in sight&mdash;Don and Fan&mdash;down in the garden,
seated on a bench under a spreading tree, the
lad whittling, his sister watching him, with
hands lying idly in her lap.</p>

<p>There was languor in the droop of her
slender figure; the eyes that rested now upon
Don's face, now on his work, were unnaturally
large and bright, and though a rich color
glowed in her cheeks, her features were thin
and sharp.</p>

<p>"Stuart," said Mrs. Keith, in low, slightly
tremulous tones, gazing fixedly at Fan as she
spoke, "I am growing uneasy about that
child; she is not well. She scarcely complains,
but is losing flesh and strength very
fast of late."</p>

<p>"Only because she is growing so rapidly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
I think, Marcia," he said; "see what a brilliant
color she has."</p>

<p>"Not the bloom of health, I fear," sighed
the mother. "I am very glad Dr. Landreth
will be here soon. I hope he may be able to
do something for her."</p>

<p>"I hope so, indeed. Perhaps it is change
of climate and scene she needs. Probably it
would have been better had she gone with the
others last fall."</p>

<p>"I don't know; it is too late to think of
it now, but if Charlie recommends a trip, we
must manage to give it to her."</p>

<p>"Certainly; and in that case you will
have to go too, for I doubt if anything could
induce Fan to leave her mother."</p>

<p>"No; what a dear, affectionate child she
is! And how she and Don cling to each
other."</p>

<p>In the pause that followed that last remark
Fan's low, clear tones came distinctly to their
ears.</p>

<p>"Ah, now I see what you are making,
Don; a spoon, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes; it'll be very useful in the journey
across the plains."</p>

<p>"Whose journey?"</p>

<p>"Mine," he said; then sang gayly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O California! oh, that's the land for me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'm bound for Sacramento,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the washbowl on my knee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That's the tune of 'O Susannah,'" she
said, as he ceased; "but where did you get
those words?"</p>

<p>"Haven't you heard it before?" he asked.
"They've been singing it all over town; the
gold fever's raging, and a lot of fellows are
talking of going off across the plains to the
California diggings. If they do, I'd like to
make one of the party."</p>

<p>The parents, silently listening, exchanged
glances of mingled surprise and concern,
while Fan exclaimed, "O Don, you can't be
in earnest?"</p>

<p>"You'd better believe I am," laughed
the lad. "Why, it would be the greatest fun
in the world, I think, to go and dig gold."</p>

<p>"Exceedingly hard work, my boy," Mr.
Keith said, raising his voice that it might
reach the lad.</p>

<p>Don started and turned his head. He had
not thought of any one but Fan hearing his
talk.</p>

<p>"But we wouldn't mind working very
hard indeed for a little while to make a fortune,
father," he answered in a lively tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
springing up and advancing to the steps of the
porch, Fan following, and seating herself upon
them.</p>

<p>"Ah, but who can insure the making of
the fortune?" asked Mr. Keith gravely.
"Where one will succeed, Don, probably
hundreds will fail and die of the great hardships
to be encountered in the search for
gold&mdash;the exhausting toil, scanty fare, and exposure
to the inclemencies of the weather. It
cannot fail to be a rough and toilsome life,
full of danger and temptation, too; for the
desperadoes and outlaws from all parts of the
country, if not of the world, are always among
the first to rush to such places; and even men
who behaved respectably at home often throw
off all restraint there, and act like savages."</p>

<p>"Think, too, of the dangers to be encountered
by the way, Don," said his mother;
"a trackless wilderness to cross, supplies of
food and water perhaps giving out, to say
nothing of perils from wild beasts and hostile
Indians."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother," he said, "if you'd ever
been a boy you'd know that danger has great
attractions sometimes."</p>

<p>"But oh, Don," exclaimed Fan, "just
think what mother, and I, and all of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
would be suffering from anxiety on your
account!"</p>

<p>"Ah, but you'd feel paid for it all when
you saw me come home with my pockets full
of gold!"</p>

<p>"Gold far too dearly bought, if you came
back to us a rough, hardened man, instead of
the dear boy you are now," said his mother.</p>

<p>"I've no notion of ever becoming a rough,
mother mine," returned the lad in a half-playful
tone; "and what is virtue worth that
can't stand temptation?"</p>

<p>"Not much, my son," said his father
gravely; "but what mockery to pray, 'Lead
us not into temptation,' and then rush needlessly
into it. But let the subject drop, for I
am quite resolved never to give my consent
to so wild a project."</p>

<p>The boy's face clouded, but, accustomed
to obedience, he ventured no reply. "Here,
Fan, I'll give this to you," he said, handing
her the now finished spoon.</p>

<p>"Thank you; it is very pretty," she returned,
regarding it admiringly.</p>

<p>"Fan, dear, I think the dew is beginning
to fall," said Mrs. Keith, rising; "come in;
come both of you. We will adjourn to the
sitting-room."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>They did so, and were there presently
joined by Frank and Ada, who came in hand
in hand, their faces full of a strange mixture
of joy and sorrow. Mrs. Keith sat in a low
rocking-chair, softly passing her hand over
Fan's hair and cheek, the young girl having
seated herself on a stool at her mother's side,
and laid her head in her lap.</p>

<p>They, as well as Mr. Keith and Don,
seemed to be silently musing as the other two
entered. But all four looked up at the sound
of their footsteps, and Mrs. Keith, noticing
the unusual expression of their countenances,
asked a little anxiously, "What is it, Ada,
my child?"</p>

<p>Ada opened her lips to reply, but no sound
came from them. Hastily withdrawing her
hand from Frank's she sprang forward, and
knelt beside her sister.</p>

<p>"Mother, oh, mother, how can I ever
leave you!" she exclaimed, tears coursing
down her cheeks.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith was much surprised, knowing
of no adequate cause for such emotion, especially
in one usually so calm and undemonstrative
as Ada.</p>

<p>"Dear child," she said, caressing her, "we
will hope never to be too far apart for frequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
intercourse. Frank's present charge is
but a few miles distant."</p>

<p>"But, mother, he thinks he is called to
foreign missions," Ada returned in trembling
tones; "can you let me go? Can you give
me to that work?"</p>

<p>The query, so sudden, so unexpected, sent
a keen pang to the tender mother's heart.
With a silent caress she drew her loved child
closer, and they mingled their tears together.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is this I hear, Frank?"
asked Mr. Keith huskily, starting up and
drawing nearer the little group; for Frank
had followed Ada, and stood looking down
upon her, his features working with emotion.</p>

<p>With an effort he controlled it, and in a
few words gave the desired information.
"He had for some time felt an increasing interest
in the foreign work, and desire to give
himself to it should it be made plain that he
was called of God to that part of the field."</p>

<p>"Oh no, no!" cried Fan, putting her arms
about her sister's neck, "we can't spare you.
Why mayn't Frank work for the Master here
as well as there? Laborers are needed in
both places."</p>

<p>"Very true," said Frank, "and I trust
our earnest desire is to be guided to that part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
of the vineyard where the Master would have
us."</p>

<p>"It shall be my prayer that you may,"
said the mother with emotion, drawing Ada's
head to a resting-place on her breast as she
spoke; "and dearly, dearly as I love my
child, hard as it will be to part with her, I
cannot hesitate for a moment if the Master
calls her to go."</p>

<p>"No, nor can I," Mr. Keith said, sighing
and bending down to stroke Ada's hair in
tender, fatherly fashion.</p>

<p>The sweetest of May mornings; the sun
shines brightly in a sky of heavenly blue,
wherein float soft, fleecy clouds of snowy
whiteness, casting faint shadows now here,
now there, over the landscape. The forest
trees have donned their spring robes of tender
green, and at their feet the earth is carpeted
with grass spangled with myriads of lovely
wild flowers of varied hues; the air is redolent
of their sweet breath and vocal with the
songs of the birds in the tree-tops and all the
pleasant sounds of rural life. Everything
seems so bright, so fresh, and new that Annis,
as the stage rolls rapidly onward, bringing her
every moment nearer home, is almost wild
with delight, while the older members of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
party, if less demonstrative, are scarcely less
happy.</p>

<p>They counted the miles, as those at home
were counting the hours and the minutes.
The journey from Philadelphia to Northern
Indiana was far more tedious and wearisome
in those days than it is now, and they were
tired enough of travel to be glad to reach
their journey's end; rest would be delightful;
but it was the thought of home and dear ones
that constituted their chief joy.</p>

<p>The stage was due in Pleasant Plains just
at noon, and to-day, having no hinderance
from bad weather or bad roads, arrived punctually
to the minute. The mail was dropped
at the post-office, a passenger at the hotel.</p>

<p>"To Lawyer Keith's next?" queried the
driver, bending down from his high seat to
bestow a roguish look and smile upon the impatient
Annis.</p>

<p>"Yes," Dr. Landreth said, "we all belong
there."</p>

<p>The stage was sweeping on again before
he had half finished his sentence.</p>

<p>In another minute it drew up at the gate,
and oh the greetings, the embraces that followed!
the happy laughter, the looks of love,
the tears of joy! for to the younger ones the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
separation had seemed very long, as, indeed,
so far as Miss Stanhope was concerned,
it really had been.</p>

<p>The mutual affection of herself and niece
was like that of mother and daughter, and
they had not seen each other's faces for more
than ten years. All the family loved the old
lady, and she came in for her full share of the
joyous welcome. Zillah was there with her
husband and babe, and Ada had her betrothed
by her side.</p>

<p>They sat down to dinner together, a large
and happy party, most of them more disposed
for conversation, however, than for doing
justice to the fare upon which Celestia Ann
had expended much thought and skill.</p>

<p>She was still with Mrs. Keith, devotedly
attached to her and the whole family, and no
one had bestowed a heartier hug upon Annis,
Mildred, or even Aunt Wealthy, than this
somewhat forward but very warm-hearted
maiden.</p>

<p>"You don't none o' ye eat half as much
as you'd orter, considerin' what a sight o'
trouble I took a-gettin' up this dinner," she
grumbled, as she waited on the table. "I
remembered all your likings&mdash;Miss Milly's,
and Miss Stanhope's, and Annis's&mdash;and done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
my best to foller 'em all. I broiled the
chickings, and smashed the 'taters, and took a
sight o' pains with the pies and puddin's; but
you don't none o' you seem to 'preciate it,
'thout it's Don there, for here I'm a-carryin'
out yer plates half full every time."</p>

<p>"That's because we have been so bountifully
helped," said Mildred. "Father has
heaped my plate with enough for two or three
meals. So you mustn't feel hurt, Celestia
Ann, for I assure you I find your cookery
delicious."</p>

<p>"So do I," said Annis. "I haven't
tasted as good since we left the Oaks."</p>

<p>A chorus of complimentary remarks followed
from the rest of the company, and
Celestia Ann's wounded vanity was appeased.</p>

<p>"Fan," Dr. Landreth remarked, looking
across the table at her, "I think you are the
worst delinquent of all of us; you have eaten
scarcely anything, and I suspect it is no new
thing, for you have grown thin since I saw
you last."</p>

<p>"Father says it's because I'm growing so
fast," Fan said, blushing with embarrassment,
as she felt that all eyes were turned
upon her. "It's spring-time, too, and that is
apt to make one lose appetite and strength."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>"I dare say you need change," remarked
Annis wisely. "You see how well and
strong I am; don't you wish now you'd gone
South with us?"</p>

<p>"No; I wouldn't have missed the nice
time I've had with mother for anything," returned
Fan, her eyes seeking her mother's
face with a look of fond affection.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith's answering smile was very
sweet. "Yes," she said, "Fan and I have
had a very pleasant, happy time together. And
now, with all our dear ones restored," glancing
fondly from Annis to Mildred and Aunt
Wealthy, "we shall be happier than ever."</p>

<p>"Home's a good place," remarked Don,
pushing away his plate, and settling himself
back in his chair with the air of one whose
appetite is fully satisfied, "but I, for one,
would like to see something of the world."</p>

<p>"Time enough yet, my boy," remarked
Dr. Landreth laughingly; "you may well
feel thankful that you are not forced out into
it now, before you are fully prepared for the
battle of life."</p>

<p>Don looked slightly vexed and impatient.
"Yes," he said, "that's the way you all talk;
it's wait, wait, wait, instead of 'strike while
the iron's hot.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"What iron?" inquired Mildred, with a
look half of interest, half of amusement.</p>

<p>"I want to go to California and dig gold,"
blurted out the boy; "but father and mother
won't hear of it, though there's a large party
starting from here next week."</p>

<p>"Oh, Don, what an idea!" exclaimed
Mildred. "I'm glad you can't win consent."</p>

<p>"I too," said the doctor. "Don, if you
knew what the life is you would not want to
try it. I have had experience of it, you remember."</p>

<p>"Who are going from here?" asked Mildred.</p>

<p>Quite a list of names was given in reply,
including those of several of her familiar acquaintance.</p>

<p>"How will they go?" she asked, a look
of grave concern coming over her face.</p>

<p>"Across the plains," answered Rupert,
"in wagons drawn by ox-teams. It can't fail
to be a slow and toilsome journey."</p>

<p>"And a dangerous one as well," added
his mother, with a deprecating look at Don.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," said the lad, "but I'm
fairly spoiling for a taste of that, mother," he
added, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>She shook her head. "Ah, my boy, I
wish you knew when you were well off."</p>

<p>They left the table, and flocked into the
parlor; but Mrs. Keith drew Dr. Landreth
aside, and whispered in his sympathizing ear
her anxiety in regard to Fan. She described
every symptom without reserve, then asked,
with a look of deep solicitude, "What do you
think of the case?"</p>

<p>"You must allow me a little time to study
it, mother," he said; "but I trust it will
prove nothing serious. She must have rest, a
tonic, a daily walk of such length as she can
take without undue fatigue, and frequent
drives. Those I can give her as I visit my
country patients."</p>

<p>"Thank you," she said. "I have been
very impatient for your return on the dear
child's account."</p>

<p>"What is that you are talking of,
mother?" Mildred asked, joining them.</p>

<p>"Of Fan, Milly; she hasn't seemed well
for some time, and I have been consulting the
doctor about her."</p>

<p>Mildred's eyes filled. "My darling little
sister!" she exclaimed. "I hope it is nothing
serious?" She turned an eager, inquiring
look upon her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will hope not, Milly," he said
cheerfully. "As your father says, she is
growing fast, and, besides, this warm spring
weather is apt to cause a feeling of languor.
I trust that with tender care and watchfulness
we may be able to help her to grow into
strong, healthful womanhood."</p>

<p>Both mother and sister looked relieved,
and presently they rejoined the others.</p>

<p>Frank Osborne was just taking leave. He
must return to the duties of his charge, and
might not see them again for several days.</p>

<p>Ada left the room with her betrothed for
a few last words.</p>

<p>When she entered the parlor again Aunt
Wealthy, making room for her on the sofa by
her side, asked, "Are you to be settled near
Pleasant Plains, dear?" adding, "I hope so,
for it would be very hard for you to go far
from father and mother, brothers and sisters,
and for them to have you do so."</p>

<p>Ada could not answer for a moment, and
when she found her voice it was tremulous
with emotion.</p>

<p>"We do not know yet, Aunt Wealthy,"
she said. "It will be hard to leave home and
dear ones, but we are ready and willing to go
wherever the Lord may send us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ada, what do you mean?" asked Mildred.
"Surely, Frank has no thought of
seeking a foreign field?"</p>

<p>"Can't you give me up if the Master
calls me away, Milly?" asked Ada, taking
her sister's hand and pressing it fondly in
hers.</p>

<p>"In that case I would not dare hold you
back if I could; His claim is far stronger than
mine," Mildred said, with emotion.</p>

<p>Then the whole story came out, and the
matter was discussed in a family council.</p>

<p>But they could go no farther than the expression
of their opinions and wishes. Frank
had already offered himself to the Board of
Foreign Missions, and his going depended
upon their acceptance or rejection.</p>

<p>"I hope they'll say, 'No, we think you
can find enough to do where you are,'" said
Annis playfully, but with eyes full of tears,
putting her arms around Ada's neck and laying
her cheek to hers as she spoke. "I'm
sure I don't know what we should ever do
without you!" she went on. "I don't like
to have you go away even as far as the country
church where Frank preaches now."</p>

<p>"Well, dear, we won't borrow trouble;
'sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof,'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Ada said, holding her close, and fondly kissing
the rosy cheek.</p>

<p>"'And as thy days, so shall thy strength
be,'" added Mrs. Keith. "Our blessed
Master will never lay upon any of us a heavier
burden than He gives us strength to bear."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert. "And now&mdash;to turn
to a pleasanter theme than the possibility of
losing Ada&mdash;Mildred, don't you want to go
and take a look at your new house, you, and
the doctor, and anybody else that cares to see
it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, is it done?" cried Annis, suddenly
forgetting her grief and loosening her hold of
Ada to clap her hands with delight.</p>

<p>"Yes, all but the papering and painting,"
replied Rupert.</p>

<p>"I move we all go in a body," said Mildred
gayly.</p>

<p>"So many of us! People would stare,"
objected Fan, with her usual timidity.</p>

<p>"What matter if they should?" laughed
Mildred. "But it is only a step, and there
are very few neighbors near enough to watch
our proceedings."</p>

<p>"And why shouldn't we be independent
and do as we please?" remarked Don loftily.
"I vote in the affirmative. Come, let's go."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>"A dozen of us, without counting the
babies," murmured Fan, with a little sigh.
But she tried on the dainty white muslin sun-bonnet
her mother handed her, took Don's
offered arm, and went with the rest.</p>

<p>As they passed from room to room Mildred's
eyes shone with pleasure.</p>

<p>The plan of the house was the joint work
of herself and husband, embodying their ideas
in regard to comfort and convenience. Rupert
had been left in charge of the work during
their absence, and had acquitted himself of
the trust to their entire satisfaction.</p>

<p>Both returned him warm thanks, Mildred
saying again and again, "I am delighted,
Ru; you have not forgotten or neglected the
least of our wishes."</p>

<p>"I am very glad it pleases you, Milly,"
he said, with a gratified look. "It has been
a labor of love to attend to it for you."</p>

<p>"It is quite done except the work of the
papers and painterers, is it not?" queried
Aunt Wealthy.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the doctor; "and we will set
the painters at work to-morrow; the paperers
as soon as our boxes of goods arrive."</p></div>

<p class="mt2">Dr. Landreth and Mildred gladly availed
themselves of a pressing invitation to take up
their old quarters at her father's until such
time as their own house should be entirely
ready for occupancy.</p>

<p>There was general rejoicing in the family
that that time was not yet; they were so glad
to have Mildred with them once more. Nor
did she regret the necessity for continuing a
little longer a member of her father's household,
especially considering that this was
Ada's last summer at home.</p>

<p>There was always a community of interests
among them, a sharing of each other's
joys and sorrows, a bearing of each other's
burdens, and so all were very busy, now helping
Mildred prepare bedding and napery,
curtains, etc., and now Ada with her trousseau,
and everything that could be thought of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
to add to her comfort in the foreign land to
which she was going; for in due time Frank
Osborne received word that he had been accepted
by the Board.</p>

<p>Many tears were shed over that news, yet
not one of those who loved her so dearly
would have held Ada back from the service
to which the Master had called her. She was
His far more than theirs, and they were His,
and would gladly give to Him of their best
and dearest.</p>

<p>Others had given up their loved ones to go
in search of gold&mdash;the wealth of this world,
that perishes with the using&mdash;parting from
them with almost breaking hearts; and should
they shrink from a like sacrifice for Him who
had bought them with His own precious
blood? and to send the glad news of His salvation
to those perishing for lack of knowledge?</p>

<p>The train of emigrants for California had
left at the set time, their relatives and friends&mdash;in
some cases wives and children&mdash;parting
from them as from those who were going almost
out of the world, and might never be
seen again.</p>

<p>A journey to California is accounted no
great thing in these days, when one may travel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
all the way by rail; but in those times, when
it was by ox-teams and wagons, across thousands
of miles of trackless wilderness, over
which wild beasts and savage Indians ranged,
it was a perilous undertaking.</p>

<p>So they who went and they who stayed
behind parted as those who had but slight hope
of ever meeting again in this lower world.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole town gathered to see the
train of wagons set forth, and even Don
Keith, as he witnessed the final leave-takings,
the clinging embraces, the tearful, sobbing
adieus, was not more than half sorry that he
was not going along.</p>

<p>Fan drew the acknowledgment from him
later in the day, when she overheard him
softly singing to himself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'I jumped aboard the old ox-team,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And cracked my whip so free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every time I thought of home,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I wished it wasn't me.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Yes, that would have been the way with
you, Don, I'm sure," Fan said; "so be wise
in time, and don't try it, even if father should
consent."</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said, turning toward
her with a roguish twinkle in his eye;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
"I think another part of the song suits me
better:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'We'll dig the mountains down,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">We'll drain the rivers dry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A million of the rocks bring home,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So, ladies, don't you cry.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"That's easier said than done, Don," Fan
remarked, with a grave, half-sad look. "Oh,
brother dear, don't let the love of gold get
possession of you!"</p>

<p>"I don't love it for itself, Fan&mdash;I hope I
never shall&mdash;but for what it can do, what it
can buy."</p>

<p>"It cannot buy the best things," she said,
looking at him with dewy eyes; "it cannot
buy heaven, it cannot buy love, or health, or
freedom from pain; no, nor a clear conscience
or quiet mind. It will seem of small account
when one comes to die."</p>

<p>"Don't talk of dying," he said a little
uneasily; "we needn't think much about that
yet&mdash;you and I, who are both so young."</p>

<p>"But a great many die young, Don, even
younger than we are to-day."</p>

<p>She laid her hand upon his arm as she
spoke, and looked into his eyes with tender
sadness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>As he noted the words, the look, and the
extreme attenuation of the little hand, a sharp
pang shot through his heart. Could it be that
Fan, his darling sister, was going to die?
The thought had never struck him before.
He knew that she was not strong, that the
doctor was prescribing for her and taking her
out driving every day, and he had perceived
that the older members of the family, particularly
his mother, were troubled about her,
but had thought it was only permanent loss of
health they feared.</p>

<p>But the idea of death was too painful to be
encouraged, and he put it hastily from him.
How could he ever do without Fan? There
was less than two years between them, and
they had always been inseparable. No, he
would not allow himself to think of the possibility
that she was about to pass away from
him to "that bourne whence no traveller returns."</p>

<p>He was glad that Annis joined them at
that moment in mirthful mood.</p>

<p>"What's so funny, Ann?" he asked, seeing
a merry twinkle in her eye.</p>

<p>"Oh, just some of Aunt Wealthy's odd mistakes.
She was talking about that first winter
we spent here, when she was with us, you remember;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
she said, 'The weather was very
cold; many's the time I've had hard work
to get my hands up, my hair was so cold.'
Then she was telling something her doctor in
Lansdale told her about a very dirty family
he was called to see. A child had the croup,
and he made them put it into a hot bath; he
was still there the next morning, and saw them
getting breakfast; and telling about it Aunt
Wealthy said, 'They used the water to make
the coffee that the child was bathed in.'"</p>

<p>"The doctor stayed and took breakfast
with them, I suppose?" said Don dryly.</p>

<p>"Not he," laughed Annis; "he said he
was very hungry, and they were kindly urgent
with him to stay and eat, but he preferred taking
a long, cold ride before breaking his fast."</p>

<p>"I admire his self-denial," remarked
Don, with gravity. "Anything else of interest
from Aunt Wealthy?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Annis; "she was speaking
of some religious book she had been reading,
and said she had bought it from a portcollier.
And yesterday, when I complained that I
hated to darn my stockings, she said, 'Oh,
my dear, always attend to that; a stocking in
a hole, or indeed a glove either, is a sure sign
of a sloven.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," said Don gravely, "I trust you
will be careful never to drop yours into
holes."</p>

<p>"Don't let us make game of dear, kind
old Aunt Wealthy," Fan said, in a gentle,
deprecating tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not for the world!" cried Annis,
"but one can't help laughing at her funny
mistakes; and indeed she is as ready to do so
as any one else."</p>

<p>"Yes; and it's very nice in her," said
Don.</p>

<p>For a while after that Don watched Fan
closely, but noticing that she was always
cheerful, bright, and interested in all that was
going on, he dismissed his fears with the consoling
idea that there could not be anything
serious amiss with her.</p>

<p>By midsummer Mildred was fairly settled
in her own house, and work for Ada was being
pushed forward with energy and dispatch.</p>

<p>The wedding&mdash;a very quiet affair&mdash;took
place in September. A few days later the
youthful pair bade a long farewell to relatives
and friends, and started for New York,
whence they were to sail, early in October,
for China.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>The parting was a sore trial to all, and no
one seemed to feel it more than Fan.</p>

<p>"Ada! Ada!" she sobbed, clinging about
her sister's neck, "I shall never, never see
you again in this world!"</p>

<p>"Don't say that, darling," responded
Ada in tones tremulous with emotion. "I am
not going out of the world, and probably we
may be back again in a few years on a visit."</p>

<p>"But I shall not be here," murmured
Fan. "Something tells me I am going on a
longer journey than yours."</p>

<p>"I hope not," Ada said, scarcely able to
speak. "You are depressed now because
you are not well, but I trust you will soon
grow strong again, and live many years to be
a comfort and help to father and mother. I
used to plan to be the one to stay at home and
take care of them in their old age, but now, I
think, that is to be your sweet task."</p>

<p>"I'd love to do it," Fan said; "I'd
rather do that than anything else, if it should
please God to make me well and strong
again."</p>

<p>"And if not, dear," Ada said, drawing
her into a closer embrace, "He will give you
strength for whatever He has in store for you,
whether it be a life of invalidism, or an early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
call to that blessed land where 'the inhabitants
shall not say, I am sick.'"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the whispered response;
"and sometimes I feel that it is very sweet
just to leave it all with Him, and have no
choice of my own."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that, my darling little
sister!" Ada exclaimed with emotion. "I
have no fear for you now, for I am sure you
are ready to go if it shall please the Master to
call you to Himself."</p>

<p>This little talk took place early in the day
of Ada's departure, she having stolen into
Fan's room as soon as she was dressed, to ask
how the invalid had passed the night.</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the mother's
entrance on the same errand.</p>

<p>Embracing both as they stood together,
"My two dear daughters," she said. Then
to Fan, "You are up and dressed early for an
ailing one, my child."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I couldn't lie in bed this
morning, the last that we shall have Ada with
us," Fan answered with a sob, and holding
her sister in a tighter clasp.</p>

<p>"The last for a time," Mrs. Keith returned
cheerfully, though the tears trembled
in her eyes. "Missionaries come home sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
on a visit, you know, and we will look
forward to that."</p>

<p>"And besides that, we know that we shall
meet in the Father's house on high; meet
never to part again," whispered Ada, pressing
her lips to her mother's cheek, then to
Fan's.</p>

<p>"But to be forever with the Lord," added
Mrs. Keith. "Now, Fan dear, sit down in
your easy-chair till the call to breakfast, and
after this try to follow your Brother Charlie's
advice&mdash;taking a good rest in the morning,
even if you have to breakfast in bed."</p>

<p>Unconsciously to herself as well as to
others the excitement of the preparations
for Ada's wedding and life in a foreign land
had been giving Fan a fictitious strength,
which immediately on her sister's departure
deserted her, and left her prostrate upon her
bed.</p>

<p>Mother and the remaining sisters nursed
her with the tenderest care, and after a time
she rallied so far as to be about the house
again and drive out occasionally in pleasant
weather; but the improvement was only
temporary, and before the winter was over it
became apparent to all that Fan was passing
away to the better land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>To all but Don and Annis. He refused to
believe it, and she, with the hopefulness of
childhood, was always "sure dear darling
Fan would soon be better."</p>

<p>For many weeks the mother shrank from
having her fears confirmed; often, as she
noted the gravity and sadness of the doctor's
face, the question trembled upon her tongue,
but she could not bring herself to speak it;
but one day, seeing, as she thought, a deeper
shade of anxiety upon his face than ever before,
she followed him from the room.</p>

<p>"Charlie," she said, in faltering accents,
"I must know the truth though my heart
break. Tell me, must my child die?"</p>

<p>"Dear mother," he said, taking her hand
in his and speaking with strong emotion, "I
wish I could give you hope, but there is
none; she may linger a month or two, but
not longer."</p>

<p>"Oh, how shall I ever tell her!" sobbed
the mother; "her, my timid little Fan, who
has always been afraid to venture among
strangers, always clung so tenaciously to home
and mother!"</p>

<p>"I think she knows it," he said, deeply
moved. "I have seen it again and again in
the look she has given me. And I doubt not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
God is fulfilling to her the promise, 'As thy
days, so shall thy strength be.'"</p>

<p>"May the Lord forgive my unbelief!" she
said. "I know that He is ever faithful to
His promises."</p>

<p>Returning to the sick-room she found Fan
lying with closed eyes, a very sweet and
peaceful expression on her face.</p>

<p>Bending over her she kissed the sweet
lips, and a hot tear fell on the child's cheek.</p>

<p>Her blue eyes opened wide, and her arm
crept round her mother's neck.</p>

<p>"Dearest mother, don't cry," she whispered.
"I am glad to go and be with Jesus.
You know it says, 'He shall gather the lambs
with His arm and carry them in His bosom.'
I shall never be afraid or timid lying there.
Oh, He will love me and take care of me,
and some day bring you there too, and
father, and all my dear ones; and oh, <em>how</em>
happy we shall be!"</p>

<p>"Yes, love," the mother said, "yours is
a blessed lot&mdash;to be taken so soon from the
sins and sorrows of earth. 'Thine eyes shall
see the King in His beauty: they shall behold
the land that is very far off.... Thine
eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a
tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed,
neither shall any of the cords thereof
be broken. But there the glorious Lord will
be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams....
And the inhabitant shall not say, I
am sick: the people that dwell therein shall
be forgiven their iniquity.'"</p>

<p>"Such sweet words," said Fan. "Oh, I
am glad Ada has gone to tell the poor heathen
of this dear Saviour! How could I bear to
die if I did not know of Him and His precious
blood that cleanseth from all sin!"</p>

<p>"Dearest child, do you feel quite willing
to go?" Mrs. Keith asked, softly stroking her
hair and gazing upon her with tear-dimmed
eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I do now, though at first
it seemed very sad, very hard to leave you all
to go and lie down all alone in the dark grave.
But I don't think of that now; I think of
being with Christ in glory, near Him and like
Him. Oh, mother, how happy I shall be!"</p>

<p>The door opened, and Mildred came softly
in. She bent over Fan, her eyes full of tears,
her features working with emotion. She had
just learned from her husband what he had
told her mother.</p>

<p>"Dear Milly," Fan said, putting an arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
about her neck, her lips to her cheek, "has
Brother Charlie told you?"</p>

<p>Mildred nodded, unable to speak.</p>

<p>"Don't fret," Fan said tenderly; "I am
not sorry, though I was at first. What is
dying but going home? Oh, don't you remember
how John tells us in the Revelation
about the great multitude that stood before
the throne and before the Lamb clothed in
white robes and with palms in their hands;
and how the angel told him, 'These are they
which came out of great tribulation, and have
washed their robes, and made them white in
the blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they
before the throne of God, and serve Him day
and night in His temple; and He that sitteth
on the throne shall dwell among them.</p>

<p>"'They shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on
them, nor any heat. For the Lamb which is
in the midst of the throne shall feed them,
and shall lead them unto living fountains of
waters: and God shall wipe away all tears
from their eyes'?</p>

<p>"Mother," turning to her with a glad,
eager look, "may I not hope to be one of
them if I trust in Jesus and bear with patience
and resignation whatever He sends?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Surely, surely, my darling," Mrs. Keith
answered, in tremulous tones. "They stand
in the righteousness of Christ, and so will all
who truly come to Him and trust only in His
atoning sacrifice."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear Fan," whispered Mildred,
caressing her with fast-falling tears, "I don't
know how to give you up. And oh, darling&mdash;but
I wish I had been a better sister to you!"</p>

<p>"Why, Milly, how could you have been?"
Fan said, with a look and tone of great surprise.
"I am sure you were always the best
and kindest of sisters to me."</p>

<p>"No, not always," Mildred said, sorrowfully;
"I used to be very impatient with you
at times when you were a little thing given to
mischief. But I feel now that I would give
worlds never to have spoken a cross word to
you."</p>

<p>"Ah, we must often have made a great
deal of trouble with our mischievous pranks&mdash;Cyril,
Don, and I"&mdash;Fan said, with a slight
smile. "Don't reproach yourself for scolding
us, Milly; I am sure we deserved it all, and
more."</p>

<p>Mr. Keith was told the doctor's opinion
that day, but the rest of the family were left
in ignorance of it for the present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>It was from Fan herself Don learned it at
length. They were alone together, and he
was talking hopefully of the time when she
would be up and about again, and he would
take her boating on the river, riding or driving,
and they would enjoy, as of old, long
rambles through the woods in search of the
sweet wild flowers that would come again with
the warm spring days.</p>

<p>"Dear Don, dear, dear brother!" she
said, giving him a look of yearning affection,
"do you not know that when those days come
I shall be walking the streets of the New
Jerusalem, gathering such fruits and flowers
as earth cannot yield?"</p>

<p>A sudden paleness overspread his face, his
eyes filled, and his lip quivered. "Fan!
Fan!" he cried, with a burst of emotion, "it
can't be so! You are too young to die, and
we can't spare you. You are weak and low-spirited
now, but you will feel better when
the bright spring days come."</p>

<p>She smiled sweetly, pityingly upon him,
softly stroking his hair with her thin white
hand as he bent over her.</p>

<p>"No, dear Don, I am not low-spirited,"
she said. "I am full of joy in the prospect
of being so soon with my Saviour. Brother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Charlie says it will not be very long now; a
week or two, perhaps."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it! I won't believe it!"
he groaned. "While there's life there's
hope. It can't be that you <em>want</em> to go away
and leave me, Fan?" and his tone was gently,
lovingly reproachful.</p>

<p>"No," she said, her voice trembling, "it
is pain to think of parting from you and the
rest, especially our dear, dear mother, and yet
I am glad to go to be with Jesus. Oh, how
I long to see His face, to bow at His feet, and
thank Him 'for the great love wherewith He
hath loved us.'"</p>

<p>"But you have a great deal to live for,
we all love you so."</p>

<p>"'In thy presence is fulness of joy,'"
she repeated; "'at thy right hand there are
pleasures forever more.'</p>

<p>"'For we know that if our earthly house
of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a
building of God, an house not made with
hands, eternal in the heavens.'</p>

<p>"'Henceforth there is laid up for me a
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the
righteous Judge, shall give me at that day:
and not to me only, but unto all them also
that love His appearing.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p>"'For since the beginning of the world
men have not heard, nor perceived by the
ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside
thee, what He hath prepared for him that
waiteth for Him.' O Don, would you keep
me from it all?"</p>

<p>"Only for a while," he said, struggling
for composure. "It is too dreadful to have
you die so young."</p>

<p>"'Blessed are the dead who die in the
Lord from henceforth,'" she repeated.
"'My people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation,
and in sure dwellings, and in quiet
resting places.' O Don, think of the
golden streets of the New Jerusalem, the
beautiful river of the water of life, the tree
of life with its twelve manner of fruits, the
white robes, the golden harps, the crowns of
glory; and that there will be no more sickness,
or sorrow, or pain; no more sin, no
night, no need of a candle to light them, nor
of the sun, or the moon, the glory of God
and Christ lighting it always.</p>

<p>"Think of Jesus making me to lie down
in green pastures and leading me beside still
waters."</p>

<p>"You seem just as sure, Fan, as if you were
already there," he said, in admiring wonder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Don, because the promise is sure&mdash;the
promise of Jesus, 'I give unto them eternal
life, and they shall never perish; neither
shall any pluck them out of my hand.'"</p>

<p>Celestia Ann came in at that moment,
carrying a china cup and plate on a small
waiter covered with a snowy napkin.</p>

<p>"Here, I've fetched you a bit o' cream
toast and a cup o' tea, Fan," she said. "I
hope you kin eat it. But, dear me, you're
lookin' all tuckered out. I'll bet Don's been
a-makin' you talk a heap more'n was good fer
ye. Now ye jest clear out, Don, and let's see
if I can't be a better nurse."</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to hurt her," Don said
gruffly, trying to hide the pain at his heart.</p>

<p>"No, and you haven't," said Fan, gazing
lovingly after him as he turned to go; "if
I've talked too much, it was my own doing."</p>

<p>Don hurrying down-stairs and into the
parlor, which he expected to find empty,
came suddenly into the midst of a little group&mdash;his
father, mother, and Mildred&mdash;conversing
together in subdued tones.</p>

<p>He was beating a hasty retreat, thinking
he had intruded upon a private interview,
when his father called him back.</p>

<p>"We have nothing to conceal from you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Don," he said, in tremulous tones, and the
lad, catching sight of the faces of his mother
and sister, perceived that they had both been
weeping. "I suppose you know that&mdash;"
Mr. Keith paused, unable to proceed.</p>

<p>"Is it about Fan?" Don asked huskily.
"Yes, sir; she has just told me. But oh, I
can't believe it! We must do something to
save her!" he burst out, in a paroxysm of
grief.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" cried Annis, coming
dancing into the room in her usual light-hearted
fashion, but startled into soberness at
sight of Don's emotion and the grief-stricken
countenances of the others.</p>

<p>Her mother motioned her to her side, and
putting an arm about her, kissed her tenderly,
the tears streaming over her face.
"Annis, dear," she said, in broken accents,
"perhaps we ought not to grieve, Fan is so
happy, but it makes our hearts sad to know
that very soon we shall see her loved face no
more upon earth."</p>

<p>"Mother!" cried Annis, hiding her face
on her mother's breast and bursting into wild
weeping, "O mother, mother, it can't be
that she's going to die! She can never bear
to go away from you!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, dear, she can," was the weeping
rejoinder. "She finds Jesus nearer and
dearer than her mother, and how can I thank
Him enough that it is so?"</p>

<p>"We have sent for Cyril," Mr. Keith
said, addressing Don, and handing him a letter.
"He hopes to be with us to-morrow.
She could not go without seeing him once
more."</p>

<p>A little later Don, left alone with Mildred,
asked, "O Milly, is there no hope? no
possibility of a favorable change?"</p>

<p>"None so far as man can see," she answered
through her tears and sobs. "But
with God all things are possible."</p>

<p>"I've been talking with her," he said
presently, when he could control his emotion
sufficiently to speak; "she told me herself
that&mdash;that she was&mdash;going away. And she
seemed so happy, so utterly without fear, that
I could hardly believe it was our timid little
Fan&mdash;always shrinking so from going among
strangers."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mildred, "what a triumph
of faith! Her fearlessness is not from any
lack of a deep sense of sin, but because she is
trusting in the imputed righteousness of
Christ. She trusts Him fully, and so her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
peace is like a river. It continually brings to
my mind that sweet text in Isaiah, 'And the
work of righteousness shall be peace; and the
effect of righteousness quietness and assurance
forever.'"</p>

<p>And so it was to the very end; the sweet
young Christian passed away so calmly and
peacefully that her loved ones watching beside
her bed scarce could tell the precise moment
when her spirit took its flight.</p>

<p>There was no gloom in the death-bed
scene, and there seemed little about the grave
as they laid her body tenderly down there to
rest till the resurrection morn, knowing that
the spirit was even then rejoicing in the presence
and love of her Redeemer.</p>

<p>"We have no need to weep for her, my
darling," Mr. Dinsmore said, softly stroking
Elsie's hair as she lay sobbing in his arms, an
open letter in her hand.</p>

<p>"No, papa, not for her, I know; but for
the others. See, Annis's letter is all blistered
with her tears, and she says it seems at times
as if her heart would break. And Don; oh,
she says Don is almost wild with grief; that he
tells her he can hardly bear to be in the house,
it is so lonely and desolate without Fan."</p>

<p>"Yes, I have no doubt they miss her
sorely; yet time will assuage their grief;
they will come to think less of their own loss
and more of her blessedness."</p>

<p>Elsie lifted her face and wiped away her
tears. "Is it not wonderful, papa," she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
"that Fan, always so timid and retiring,
always clinging so to her mother and home,
should be so willing and even glad to go?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "it shows what the grace
of God can do. She must have been given a
very strong sense of her Saviour's love and
presence with her as she passed through the
valley of the shadow of death. It helps one
to stronger faith in the precious promise,
'As thy days, so shall thy strength be.'"</p>

<p>Rose, sitting by reading a letter with fast-falling
tears, wiped them away at that, and looking
up, said, "Let me read you some things
that Mildred tells me about her last hours."</p>

<p>"We will be glad to hear them," Mr.
Dinsmore answered, and she began:</p>

<p>"'It was the loveliest death-bed scene&mdash;no
fear, no desire to stay. As I stood beside
her, an hour or two before the messenger
came, I leaned over her and repeated the
words, "The eternal God is thy refuge, and
underneath are the everlasting arms."</p>

<p>"'She looked up with the sweetest smile.
"Yes," she said, "Jesus is with me, and I
am not afraid; He will carry me safely
through the river."</p>

<p>"'Mother added: "And to a beautiful
home&mdash;one of the many mansions He has prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
for His people. You may be sure it is
very lovely, very delightful with everything
you can possibly desire; for the wealth of
the universe is His; He has all power in
heaven and in earth; and you, for whom He
has been making it ready, are dearer far to
His heart than to mine.</p>

<p>"'"Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,
neither have entered into the heart of man,
the things that God hath prepared for them
that love Him."</p>

<p>"'Her look was ecstatic as she listened.
"Oh, how happy I shall be!" she exclaimed.
"And it will seem only a very little while
till you will all join me there."</p>

<p>"'She has brought heaven very near to
us all,' Mildred added. 'It seems far more
real to me than it ever did before. She has
entered into the joy of the Lord, and we cannot
mourn at all for her, though our hearts
are sore with our own loss.</p>

<p>"'"Precious in the sight of the Lord is
the death of His saints." Does He not
gather them home with joy and rejoicing to
the mansions His love has made beautiful beyond
compare for them? I think our little
Fan was so dear to Him that He could no
longer spare her to us, nor was willing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
leave her any longer in this world of sin and
suffering. That is our mother's feeling,
father's too, I think; and no one could be
more resigned, more perfectly submissive,
than they are.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, Marcia is a devoted Christian,"
Mr. Dinsmore said; and, drawing Elsie into
a closer embrace, "I feel deeply for her in
this sore bereavement."</p>

<p>He was asking himself, as again and again
he pressed his lips to his daughter's fair brow,
how he could ever endure such a loss.</p>

<p>There had been a steady correspondence
between Rose and Mildred, Annis and Elsie,
ever since the winter spent at the Oaks by Dr.
and Mrs. Landreth and Annis.</p>

<p>Housekeeping cares and discussions in regard
to the best manner of rearing their little
ones filled no small part of the letters of the
two young mothers.</p>

<p>Elsie and Annis wrote of their studies,
amusements, and the every-day occurrences in
each family.</p>

<p>Thus Annis had learned about the life Elsie
and her father led together while Rose was
absent, of their journey to Philadelphia when
he found himself able to go for his wife and
little Horace, the visit there, and the return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
trip; and Elsie had been kept informed,
among other events, of the progress of Fan's
sickness; and the letter received to-day had
given an account of her death and burial.</p>

<p>"Papa," Elsie asked, lifting her weeping
eyes to his face, "what can I say to comfort
poor dear Annis?"</p>

<p>"Just what I have been asking myself in
regard to Marcia," he remarked, with a deep-drawn
sigh.</p>

<p>"And I about Mildred," Rose said, echoing
the sigh. "I know of scarcely anything
more delicate and difficult than the writing of
a letter of condolence."</p>

<p>"It is extremely so in a case where there
is any doubt of the happiness of the departed,"
Mr. Dinsmore said; "but comparatively
easy when we know that to the dear one gone
to be absent from the body is to be present
with the Lord. Also that the mourners are
of those who have a good hope through grace
that it shall be so with themselves."</p>

<p>"I shall look for Bible words," Elsie said,
leaving her father's knee to get her own little
copy, lying on a table near at hand.</p>

<p>"Bring it here, and let us look it over together,"
her father said; and obeying with
alacrity, she again seated herself upon his knee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Rose brought another Bible and a concordance,
and joined them in their search for
whatever the blessed Book could tell them of
the employments and enjoyments of heaven.
They found it spoken of as a rest, as the
Father's house, a heavenly country, the
kingdom of Christ and of God; that they
who overcome and reach that glorious place
shall eat of the hidden manna, shall walk with
Christ in white; that He will wipe away all
tears from their eyes; that He will feed them
and lead them unto living fountains of waters;
that He will dwell among them, and they
shall serve Him day and night in His temple.</p>

<p>That "they shall hunger no more, neither
thirst any more; neither shall the sun light
on them, nor any heat;" that they have
palms of victory, white robes, and crowns, and
harps of gold; and that they stand before the
throne and sing a new song, which no man can
learn but those who are redeemed from the
earth.</p>

<p>"And God shall wipe away all tears from
their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there
be any more pain: for the former things are
passed away."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Elsie, "Enna told me once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
she didn't want to go to heaven and stand and
sing all the time; she would get tired of that.
I feel as if I should never grow weary of singing
God's praise. I love those words of one
of our hymns:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'When we've been there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten thousand years,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bright shining as the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've no less days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sing God's praise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than when we first begun.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"But surely singing is not the only employment
there; for here in the twenty-first chapter of
Revelation it says, 'And the nations of them
which are saved shall walk in the light of it.'
Then in the third verse of the next chapter,
'The throne of God and the Lamb shall be in
it; and His servants shall serve Him.' Don't
you think that means that He will give us
some work to do for Him?"</p>

<p>Her face was full of an eager joy.</p>

<p>"Yes," Mr. Dinsmore said, "I do. Just
what it will be the Bible does not tell us, but
to those who love the Master it must be a delight
to do whatever He bids. The rest of
heaven will not be that of inaction, but the far
more enjoyable one of useful employment
without any sense of weariness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Perhaps He may sometimes send His
redeemed ones on errands of mercy or consolation
to the inhabitants of this or some other
world."</p>

<p>"How sweet that would be!" exclaimed
Elsie, joyously. "Papa, if I should go first,
what happiness it would be to come back
sometimes and comfort you in your hours of
sadness."</p>

<p>"I should rather have you here in the
body," he said, tightening his clasp about her
waist.</p>

<p>"God has not seen fit to gratify idle curiosity
in regard to these matters," he resumed,
"but He has told us enough to leave no room
for doubt that heaven is an abode of transcendent
bliss."</p>

<p>"Yes, papa, just to know that we will
be forever with the Lord&mdash;near Him and like
Him&mdash;is quite enough to make one long to be
there. Dear, dear Fan! How blest she is!
Who could wish her back again!"</p>

<p>"No one who loves her with an unselfish
love. And now I think we may write our
letters."</p>

<p>"No doubt they already know all that we
can tell them, for they are students of the
Word, every one," observed Rose. "Yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
does one good to have these precious truths
repeated many times."</p>

<p>"Yes," said her husband, "we are so
prone to forgetfulness and unbelief, and
Satan is so constantly on the watch to snatch
away the word out of our hearts and destroy
our comfort, if he could do nothing more."</p>

<p>"Papa," said Elsie, "I sometimes feel so
afraid of him; then I remember that Jesus is
so much stronger, and I seem to run right
into His arms, and am full of joy that there I
am so safe. You know He says of His people,
'I give unto them eternal life; and they
shall never perish, neither shall any pluck
them out of my hand.'"</p>

<p>"No, not all the powers of hell can do it,
for 'He is able to save them to the uttermost
that come unto God by Him.' He said, 'All
power is given unto me in heaven and in
earth.' And 'I am persuaded that neither
death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities,
nor powers, nor things present, nor things to
come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from the
love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our
Lord.'"</p></div>

<p class="mt2">Mildred was in her pretty sitting-room
busily plying her needle, little Percy playing
about the floor&mdash;rolling a ball hither and
thither.</p>

<p>Both mother and child were neatly attired&mdash;the
little one in spotless white, his golden
curls hanging about his neck, and half-shading
a round rosy face with big blue eyes; the
mother in a dark cashmere, which fell in soft
folds around her graceful figure, and was relieved
at throat and wrists by dainty white
ruffles of lace; her hair was becomingly arranged,
and she had never presented a more
attractive appearance, even in the days of her
girlhood.</p>

<p>Mildred was not one of those who are less
careful to please the husband than the lover;
she studied Charlie's tastes and wishes even
more carefully now than had been her wont
before they were married. Perhaps in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
lay the secret of his undiminished and lover-like
devotion to her.</p>

<p>Both he and she had a great aversion to
mourning, therefore were glad that Fan had
particularly requested that none should be
worn for her.</p>

<p>It was a little past their usual hour for
tea, and the open dining-room door gave a
glimpse of a table covered with snowy damask
and glittering with polished silver, cut glass,
and china; but Dr. Landreth was closeted
with some one in his office on the other side
of the hall, and his wife waited the departure
of the patient a trifle anxiously, fearing that
her carefully prepared viands would lose their
finest flavor, if not be rendered quite tasteless
by standing so long.</p>

<p>"Shall I make de waffles in de iron,
ma'am?" asked Gretchen, coming to the
door.</p>

<p>"No, not yet," said Mildred, "they
would be cooked too soon; the doctor likes
them best just as they are ready."</p>

<p>"De iron gets too hot," observed the girl.</p>

<p>"Yes, take it off, Gretchen. I can't tell
just how soon the doctor will be in, so we
will have to keep him waiting while we heat
the iron."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl went back to her kitchen, and
Percy, dropping his toys, came to his mother's
side with a petition to be taken into her lap.</p>

<p>She laid aside her sewing, took him on her
knee, and amused him with stories suited to
his baby mind.</p>

<p>At length she heard the office door open,
and a familiar voice saying, "Well, Charlie,
I shall take the matter into consideration.
Am much obliged for your advice, whether I
follow it or not."</p>

<p>Mildred hastily set Percy down, and ran to
the door.</p>

<p>"Rupert," she said, "won't you stay to
tea?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Milly, not to-night," he answered.
"I have already declined a warm
invitation from Charlie." And with a hasty
"Good-by" he hurried away.</p>

<p>Mildred thought her husband's face unusually
grave, even troubled, as he came into
the sitting-room, and a sudden fear assailed her.</p>

<p>"Charlie," she cried, her cheek paling,
"what&mdash;what was Rupert consulting you
about?"</p>

<p>"Don't be alarmed, Milly, love," he answered,
taking his boy upon one arm and putting
the other about her waist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have thought for some time that
Rupert was growing thin and haggard," she
said brokenly, tears filling her eyes, and&mdash;"O
Charlie, I have often noticed, and heard it
remarked, that one death in a family is apt to
follow closely upon another."</p>

<p>She ended with a sob, laying her head on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Don't ky, mamma," cooed little Percy,
patting her cheek; "oo baby boy tiss oo,
make oo all well."</p>

<p>She lifted her head, returned the caresses
lavished upon her by both husband and child,
then asked earnestly and half pleadingly,
"Won't you tell me if&mdash;if Rupert is seriously
ill?"</p>

<p>"He is broken down with overwork; has
been devoting himself too closely to business,
and needs an entire change for a time," replied
her husband, speaking in a cheerful
tone. "If he will take that at once and for
a long enough time he may, I think, be restored
to full health and vigor."</p>

<p>"Surely, surely he will do so without delay?"</p>

<p>"I can't say; he thinks it almost impossible
to leave his business at present, and
would rather try half-way measures first."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>"He must be persuaded out of that, and
I think can be," she said, her countenance
brightening. "Now you must excuse me
for a few minutes, my dear; Gretchen is improving,
but I cannot yet trust her to bake
your waffles quite to my mind."</p>

<p>"Let her try, Milly; how else is she ever
to learn?"</p>

<p>"I shall after I have seen that the iron is
properly heated and filled," she answered, as
she hastened away to the kitchen.</p>

<p>Celestia Ann was at the front gate as
Rupert neared it. She turned her head at
the sound of his footsteps.</p>

<p>"So here you be at last!" she exclaimed;
"and I was lookin' right in the wrong direction.
Been up to the doctor's, I s'pose?
Well, they're set down to the table without
ye. We waited a spell, an' then I told your
mother t'want no use, fer ye don't eat
nothin' nohow, let me fix up the victuals
good's I can."</p>

<p>"I am late, and am sorry if the meal has
been kept waiting," Rupert answered, as he
hurried past her into the house.</p>

<p>His mother gave him a kindly affectionate
smile as he entered the dining-room, and
stopped his apology half way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind, my son, it is no matter,
except that your meal will not, I fear, be quite
so good and enjoyable, which is a pity, as your
appetite is so poor of late."</p>

<p>There was some anxiety in her look and
tone, also in the glance his father gave him
as he seated himself at the table.</p>

<p>"I fear you are working too hard,
Rupert," he said; "confining yourself too
closely to business."</p>

<p>"Just what Charlie has been telling me,"
the young man responded with a half sigh;
"but how is it to be helped?"</p>

<p>"By putting health before business," his
mother said, with decision. "My dear boy, if
you lose your health, what will become of
your business?"</p>

<p>"True, mother," he sighed; "but I
have not quite given up the hope that I may
regain the one without relinquishing the
other."</p>

<p>"A pound of prevention is worth an
ounce of cure," remarked Aunt Wealthy
absently, rather as if thinking aloud than addressing
the company.</p>

<p>"What does Charlie advise?" asked Mrs.
Keith.</p>

<p>"An entire change for some months or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
year, including a journey to some distant
point. Quite impracticable, is it not, father?"
Rupert asked, turning to him.</p>

<p>"If you want my opinion," replied Mr.
Keith, "I say nothing is impracticable which
is necessary to the preservation of your life or
even of your health. We cannot spare you,
my son," he continued with emotion; "it is
to you more than any of the others that your
mother and I look as the prop and support of
our old age."</p>

<p>"Thank you, father," Rupert said with
feeling; "that pleasing task would, of course,
naturally fall to me as the eldest son, though
if I were taken away, my brothers, I am sure,
would be no less glad to undertake it."</p>

<p>"No; it would be the greatest joy in
life," said Don with warmth, glancing affectionately
from one to the other of his parents.
"I can answer for Cyril as well as myself."</p>

<p>"I haven't the least doubt of it, Don,"
replied his father, while the mother said, with
glistening eyes, "We are rich in the affection
of our children, both boys and girls," she
added, with a loving look into Annis's blue
eyes.</p>

<p>The eyes filled with tears. Annis was
thinking how often she had heard Fan say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
that she was to be the one always to stay at
home and take care of father and mother; dear
Fan, who had now been nearly two months in
heaven.</p>

<p>Oh, how they all missed her at every turn,
though Annis strove earnestly to supply her
place.</p>

<p>Leaving the table, they all repaired to the
sitting-room; but Don, after lingering a moment,
took up his cap, and moved toward the
hall door.</p>

<p>"Don't forsake us, Don," said his
mother, following his movements with a look
of mingled love and sadness. It was no secret
to her that the house seemed to him unbearably
desolate, deprived of the loved presence
of his favorite sister.</p>

<p>"Only for a few minutes, mother; I
want a chat with Wallace, and this is about
the best time to catch him at leisure."</p>

<p>"My poor boy!" sighed Mrs. Keith, as
the door closed on him.</p>

<p>"Yes, he feels very sad and lonely," said
Rupert. "But I am glad he has left us for
a little while, for I want to have a talk with
you and father about him; myself also," he
added, with a faint smile. "Don't go, Aunt
Wealthy," as Miss Stanhope rose as if to leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
the room; "what I have to say need be no
secret from you, and I think we will all be glad
of your counsel in the matter."</p>

<p>She sat down again, and Annis asked,
"May I stay too, Rupert?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, inviting her to a seat by
his side.</p>

<p>He then proceeded to give an account of
his interview with Dr. Landreth, stating that
he strongly advised him to wind up his business,
or make some sort of arrangement for
leaving it for a year or more, and join a party
preparing to go to California; the journey
across the plains he thought would prove the
very thing for him; nothing else so likely to
restore his shattered health.</p>

<p>"And I have been thinking," added
Rupert, "that it might be the very best thing
for Don if you, father and mother, would
consent to let him go with me, in case I follow
Charlie's advice. He seems to me as ill
mentally as I am physically, and we would
be mutual helpers.</p>

<p>"I have no idea that we should make our
fortunes at gold-digging, but I doubt if the
boy will ever be content till he has tried his
hand at it. But let his dreams be dispelled,
and he will be ready to settle down at home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he ever gets home again," remarked
the father. "It may be that you are right
though, Rupert, and your mother and I will
take the matter into consideration."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, in regard to us both, I hope; I
want your advice as to my own course; it will
go far to help me decide what I ought to do."</p>

<p>Both parents looked gratified, while Miss
Stanhope remarked, "You are quite right in
that, Rupert; you could not have wiser counsellors
than they, and certainly none so deeply
interested in your welfare; nor will you,
or any one, ever lose by honoring parents."</p>

<p>"I am very fortunate in having parents
worthy of all honor, Aunt Wealthy," he said,
with an affectionate glance from one to the
other. "Mother, dear, do not look so sad,"
perceiving that her eyes were full of tears;
"I cannot think of going, if it is to be at the
risk of breaking your heart."</p>

<p>"No, my heart will not break," she said
in a determinately cheerful tone; "the promise
is sure, 'As thy days, so shall thy strength
be.' And it will be better to part with you
for a time than forever in this life," she added
with a tremble in her voice. "Also I
should be more willing to see two of my boys
go together than any one of them alone."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then if I go, you will consent to Don's
accompanying me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you, father?"</p>

<p>"I feel just as your mother does about
it," was Mr. Keith's reply.</p>

<p>"But if Don should not wish to go?"
suggested Miss Stanhope, in a tone of inquiry.</p>

<p>"Oh, no fear of that, auntie," laughed
Annis; "he's been crazy to go ever since the
first news of the gold, and you can't scare
him out of it either; the more you talk of
Indians, bears, and wolves, and all other dangers,
the more he wants to try it. He says
life in this little slow town is altogether too
tame to suit a fellow of spirit."</p>

<p>"Better suited to the humdrum class represented
by his father and older brother, I presume,"
said Rupert, with a good-humored
smile.</p>

<p>As Don stepped in at Wallace Ormsby's
gate, Zillah opened the front door, ran out,
and hastily caught up little Stuart, who was
digging in the sand, and carried him struggling
and screaming into the house.</p>

<p>"It's too cold for you to be out; mamma
can't let you; mamma told you not to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
out," she was saying as Don followed her into
the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"I will doe out! Ope de door!"
screamed the child; "me wants pay in de
sand."</p>

<p>"No, you can't go out any more to-night,"
replied the mother, giving him a hug
and kiss. "Oh, he's mamma's darling! there
never was such a boy in all the world! there
never was! Mamma loves him ever so
much."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the child was struggling with
all his baby might to get away from her, kicking,
striking, screaming at the top of his
voice, "I will doe out! <em>I will! I will!</em>
Shan't 'tay in de house!"</p>

<p>"Oh, now, be a dear good boy," entreated
Zillah; "he's mamma's own pet, the dearest,
sweetest boy in the world; mamma thinks
there never was such a boy!"</p>

<p>"I should hope not, if that's the way he
carries on," remarked Don, seating himself
and regarding his nephew with a look of disgust
and disapproval. "I think he's spoiling
for a spanking, and if he were my child he'd
get it."</p>

<p>Zillah flushed hotly. "Men and boys
have no patience with children," she said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
"There, Stuart, stop crying, and mamma will
get you something good."</p>

<p>"No; ope door; me want doe out; me
<em>will</em> doe out!" screamed the child.</p>

<p>"Oh, now, do be good; do stop crying,
and mamma will get you some candy," said
Zillah, in her most coaxing tones.</p>

<p>"Tanny, mamma?" asked the child, the
screams suddenly ceasing, and smiles breaking
through the tears.</p>

<p>"Yes," Zillah said, drying his eyes and
kissing him fondly, then rising with him in
her arms and going to a cupboard.</p>

<p>But the size of the piece she offered did
not suit the ideas of the young tyrant; he refused
to accept it, and bursting into screams
again demanded a bigger one.</p>

<p>"Take this in one hand, and you shall have
a bigger piece in the other," said the over-indulgent
mamma, and peace being restored she
sat down with him on her lap, and began talking
with Don.</p>

<p>"Where's Wallace?" the latter presently
inquired.</p>

<p>"He went down-town again after tea, but
said he wouldn't be gone very long. Do you
want to see him particularly?"</p>

<p>"I would like a talk with him," Don said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
with a sigh. "I wish he would try to get
father and mother to consent to my joining
the party that are going to California."</p>

<p>"O Don, how can you suggest such a
thing now when they are feeling so sad over
poor Fan?" exclaimed Zillah, tears starting
to her eyes.</p>

<p>"Don't think me hard-hearted or wanting
in love for them," Don returned with feeling;
"but the truth is I don't know how to endure
life here now that Fan's gone. I miss her at
every turn. I think it would be different in
a new place where I had not been accustomed
to her sweet society." His words were almost
inaudible from emotion as he concluded.</p>

<p>"I know," Zillah said in trembling tones;
"we all miss her sadly, but I suppose it must
be harder, perhaps, for you than any of the
rest. Still you will soon grow in a measure
used to it, no doubt. I have always heard
that time assuages the bitterness of grief."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it, I don't believe it!"
he cried impatiently; "at least I am sure it
will not be so in my case for years, unless I can
get away into new scenes that will help me to
forgetfulness."</p>

<p>At that instant Stuart, who had got down
from his mother's lap to play about the room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
tripped and fell to the floor, striking his head
against a chair.</p>

<p>He set up a loud scream, and Zillah ran
to the rescue, picking him up with a cry of
"Oh, poor darling, mamma is so sorry! oh, it
is just dreadful how many falls he gets! But
there, never mind; it was a naughty chair
that hurt my baby so. We'll give it a good
whipping," striking it with her hand several
times as she spoke.</p>

<p>Stuart ceased screaming to pound the
chair energetically with his tiny doubled-up
fist, then consented to be bribed into quiet
with another piece of candy.</p>

<p>Zillah sat down again with him on her lap,
and presently he dropped asleep there.</p>

<p>"He ought to be in bed," remarked Don.</p>

<p>"Yes; but he didn't want to go, and I do
so hate to have a battle with him."</p>

<p>"I rather think it will have to come to
that sooner or later," said Don, "and I
should think the longer you put it off the
harder it will be. I've been at Milly's a good
deal the last few weeks, besides watching her
when she was at home with us, and I think she
could give you some valuable hints about
managing a child."</p>

<p>"It is a vast deal easier to talk than to act,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
I can tell you, Don," was Zillah's half-offended
retort.</p>

<p>"I dare say; but people can act as well as
talk; father and mother did with us&mdash;we
always had to obey, and that without being
petted and wheedled into it&mdash;and Milly does
too."</p>

<p>"I think it's a great deal better to coax
than to beat them," Zillah said half angrily.</p>

<p>"Circumstances alter cases," said Don.
"I don't think it's just the thing to pet and
fondle a child, and tell him he's 'a darling;
there never was such a boy,' and all that,
when he's kicking up a row just because he
isn't allowed to do exactly as he pleases.
Percy began that very behavior the other
evening when he had to go into the house before
he considered it quite time."</p>

<p>"Well, what did Milly do with him?" inquired
Zillah, with some curiosity.</p>

<p>"She first told him firmly and quietly that
he must stop screaming on the instant, or she
would shut him into a room by himself till he
was ready to be good; and as she always
keeps her word, not threatening over and over
again before she acts, as some people do, he
did stop promptly; then she took him on her
lap and amused him with stories and rhymes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
a little while, when she carried him off to
bed.</p>

<p>"She's always gentle with him, but firm
as a rock; as regular as clock-work too; he's
put to bed when the hour comes, and left
there to go to sleep by himself, and he does
it without a whimper."</p>

<p>"I suppose that's the orthodox way," said
Zillah, "but I can't bear to force Stuart to
bed when he cries to stay up. The sweet
darling, I do love him so!" bending down
to kiss the round rosy cheek.</p>

<p>"I've no doubt you do," said Don;
"but I remember to have heard mother say it
was but a poor selfish kind of love that couldn't
bear the pain of controlling a child for its own
good, but would rather let it become so wilful
and ill-behaved as to be a torment to itself and
everybody else. Ah, here comes Wallace,"
he added, glancing from the window.</p>

<p>"Then I'll leave you to have your talk
with him while I put this boy to bed," returned
Zillah, rising and leaving the room.</p>

<p>Wallace was no sooner seated than Don
made known his errand.</p>

<p>Wallace looked grave. "I don't like the
idea, Don," he said. "I wish you could be
persuaded to give it up. If you should be unsuccessful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
of which there are ten chances to
one, it would involve the loss of some of the
best years of your life."</p>

<p>"One must take a risk in anything one
tries," interrupted Don, impatiently.</p>

<p>"True," replied Wallace, "but in this
more than in many others."</p>

<p>"'Nothing venture, nothing have,'"
muttered Don.</p>

<p>"I thought you were to go to college in
the fall," remarked Wallace.</p>

<p>"That has been father's plan for me, but
as I have no fancy for a profession, I think a
college course would be almost time thrown
away&mdash;money too. Ru has proposed to
make a druggist of me, but that isn't to my
fancy either."</p>

<p>"I wish you would go in with Ru, if you
are determined not to take a collegiate education.
I can see that he, poor fellow, is sadly
overworked, and to have a brother in with
him&mdash;one whom he could trust&mdash;would doubtless
prove a great relief."</p>

<p>"Ru hasn't seemed well of late," assented
Don in a reflective tone, "but I was laying
it all to&mdash;to grief. Wallace, the house
isn't what it used to be. I've thought I
couldn't stand it. I've been a selfish dog,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
but I'll try to forget self and think of other
people. Good-evening. I promised mother
I'd be back soon," he added, as he rose and
took his departure.</p>

<p>His heart was filled with grief and disappointment;
he crossed the street slowly, with
head bent and eyes on the ground, battling
earnestly with himself, striving to put aside
his own inclinations for the sake of others.</p>

<p>He found the family still gathered in the
sitting-room, Dr. Landreth and Mildred with
them.</p>

<p>As he entered the doctor was saying to
Rupert, "I have been considering your objections
to my plans for you, and think I can
see a way out of the difficulty in regard to
leaving your business."</p>

<p>"What is that?" Rupert asked, and Don,
aroused to eager interest, dropped into a chair
and listened for the doctor's explanation with
bated breath. "Could it be that Rupert was
going from home? and if so, where? and
what difference might it make in his own
plans?"</p>

<p>"Simply this," returned Dr. Landreth,
with his genial smile, "that I will take charge
of it and carry it on for you, if that arrangement
seems to you entirely satisfactory."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>"A most generous offer, Charlie!" exclaimed
Rupert, flushing with surprise and
gratitude, "but would it not interfere with
your professional duties?"</p>

<p>"No; not necessarily. I should merely
take the oversight, keeping the good clerk you
have, and getting another equally competent&mdash;the
two to do the work between them."</p>

<p>"Many thanks," said Rupert, grasping
his brother-in-law's hand; "you have removed
my greatest difficulty. I begin to think I
can follow out your prescriptions, if"&mdash;and he
turned smilingly to Don&mdash;"if Don is as
ready to sacrifice himself for my sake."</p>

<p>"I hope so, Ru; what is it?" the boy
asked, a trifle huskily, for his momentary
gleam of hope died out at the question.</p>

<p>It shone out with tenfold brilliancy at his
brother's reply. "Charlie thinks I am in
danger of permanent loss of health unless I
give up my business for a time, and have an
entire change of scene; so he advises me to
join the party about starting for California.
He thinks the journey across the plains just
the thing for me. But I ought to have some
friend&mdash;say a brother&mdash;with me; so it may
depend upon your willingness to go."</p>

<p>"My willingness?" interrupted Don<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
eagerly; "I'd be delighted, Ru, and do the
very best for you that I know how."</p>

<p>The mother was regarding them with glistening
eyes, her lips quivering with emotion.</p>

<p>"And let him give you the care and oversight
an elder brother should?" asked the
father gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, if he doesn't try to exert more
than his rightful share of authority," returned
Don, a slight reluctance perceptible in his
tone.</p>

<p>"On that condition your mother and I
consent to your going," Mr. Keith said,
"though, my boy, it will be hard indeed for
us to part with you our youngest son."</p>

<p>Don saw the tears in his mother's eyes,
noted that his father's tones were not quite
steady, and his heart went out in love to both.
"I will never, never do anything to cause
them shame or grief on my account," was the
firm resolve he whispered to himself.</p>

<p>There was necessity for speedy decision,
and it was arrived at within twenty-four hours.
The young men were to go. The allotted
time was short for needed preparation, particularly
that which fell to the mother's share;
but her three remaining daughters and Miss
Stanhope coming to her assistance, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
working with a will, the thing was done well
and in season; nothing forgotten, nothing
overlooked that could add to the comfort of
the loved travellers.</p>

<p>And it was well for all that matters were
so hurried, leaving no leisure for sad forebodings
or unavailing regrets.</p>

<p>The parting was a hard one, almost harder,
the mother thought, than the last she had
been called to pass through; for while her
beloved Fan was safe from all sin, and sorrow,
and suffering, these dear ones were to be exposed
to many dangers and temptations.</p>

<p>But she bore up wonderfully as she bade
them adieu and watched the slow-moving train
out of sight; they were not going beyond the
reach of prayer; they would still be under
the protecting care of Him who has said,
"Behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee
in all places whither thou goest, and will
bring thee again into this land; for I will
not leave thee, until I have done that which I
have spoken to thee of."</p>

<p>"Wherever they might be, He would
cover their defenceless heads with the shadow
of His wing."</p>

<p>Annis's tears fell much longer and faster
than her mother's; the letter she wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Elsie, giving a graphic account of the preparations
and departure, was all blistered with
them, even more so than the one telling of
Fan's last hours.</p>

<p>"I am the only child left at home now,"
she wrote. "That was what mother said
when we got back from seeing the long train
of wagons, with their ox-teams, starting on that
long, dangerous journey. She took me in her
arms, and cried over me for a few minutes;
then she wiped away her tears, and kissed me
over and over, saying, 'But we won't murmur,
darling, or make ourselves unhappy about it;
for they are all in God's good keeping, and
one day, I trust, we shall all meet in that better
land where partings are unknown.'</p>

<p>"And I have great reason to be thankful
that Mildred and Zillah are so near us; it is
almost as if they were still at home."</p>

<p>The letter wound up with an earnest request
to Elsie that she would pray daily for
the safe return of Rupert and Don.</p>

<p class="center">"A child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Prov.
29:15.</span></p>


<p class="mt2">May had come again, waking the flowers
with her sunny skies and balmy breath, and
our friends at Pleasant Plains spent much of
their time in their gardens. Delighting in
each other's society they were often together,
now in Mr. Keith's grounds, now in Dr.
Landreth's, and anon in Wallace Ormsby's.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith missed her sons, who had always
relieved her of the heavy part of the
work of cultivating the flowers she so loved,
but their place was filled, so far as that was
concerned, by a hired gardener, and she
found herself better able to endure the absence
of Rupert and Don out of doors than
in, especially when her daughters and baby
grandsons were her companions.</p>

<p>Mildred took great pleasure in the laying
out and improvement of the comparatively extensive
grounds about her new home, and husband,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
mother, aunt, and sisters entered heartily
into her plans, helping with advice and
suggestions, sometimes followed, sometimes
not, but always appreciated as evidence of
their affectionate interests.</p>

<p>As for her husband, she and all her doings
were altogether perfect in his eyes. She was
queen of his small realm, and could do no
wrong; she excelled every other woman as
wife, mother, and housekeeper; her taste was
beyond criticism, and whatever she desired
must be done.</p>

<p>He was nearly as great a paragon in her
eyes, except as regarded the training of their
child, to whom he would have shown unlimited
indulgence, if she could have seen it without
remonstrance. That she could not,
knowing how ruinous it would be; but her
disapproval was never manifested before
Percy. She would not have him know or
suspect that his parents differed in regard to
his training.</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was only when she and
Charlie were quite alone that she addressed
him on the subject; never then in an unkind,
fault-finding way, but with gentle persuasion
and arguments drawn from observation and
the teachings of Scripture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Loving the child with an affection even
deeper and tenderer than his, she was yet
much more disposed to curb and restrain
where she saw it to be for his good; her sense
of parental responsibility was far stronger than
the father's, and while he looked upon Percy
as, for the present at least, scarcely more than
a pretty pet and plaything, she regarded the
child as a sacred trust, a little immortal whose
welfare for time and eternity might depend
largely upon her faithfulness in right training
and teaching.</p>

<p>"My dear Milly, he is so young, such a
mere baby," the doctor would sometimes say,
"that it can't do him much harm to get his
own way for a while; it will be time enough
a year or two hence to begin his education."</p>

<p>"A very great mistake," Mildred would
answer gravely; "I have had a good deal to
do with young children, and am convinced
that a child's education begins as soon as it
knows its mother's voice and can note the
changing expression of her countenance.
And, Charlie, it is far easier to learn than to
unlearn; if we let our child acquire bad habits
at the start it will be a far more difficult task
to break them up and substitute good ones,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
than to train him to such in the very beginning."</p>

<p>Zillah was quite as devoted a wife and
competent a housekeeper as her older sister,
but not so wise and faithful a mother. No
child was more comfortably or tastefully clad
than hers, or had more tender caresses lavished
upon it; she meant also to take proper
care of his bodily health, and was quite resolved
in the long run to train him up in the
way he should go; she wanted him to grow
up a good man and a strong and healthy one,
but in the mean time was often weakly indulgent,
to the damage of both his physical and
moral natures.</p>

<p>The two sisters, taking work and babies
along, were spending a sociable afternoon with
their mother.</p>

<p>The little boys, playing about the room,
met with an occasional mishap.</p>

<p>Percy tripped on the carpet and fell, striking
his head against the leg of the table.</p>

<p>He burst into a cry, and Annis, running
to pick him up, exclaimed, "Oh, the poor
little dear! that did hurt him, I know."</p>

<p>But Mildred, taking him from her, said in
a sprightly tone, "Oh, he's mother's soldier
boy; he isn't going to cry for a trifle. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
what a blow the table got! poor table!" and
she bent down and stroked and patted it pityingly.</p>

<p>Percy stopped crying to echo her words
and imitate her action. "Percy didn't doe
to hurt oo," he went on; "Percy tiss the
p'ace and mate it well," suiting the action to
the word.</p>

<p>Then his mother having dried his eyes
and given him a kiss, he went back to his play.</p>

<p>Zillah had watched the little scene with
interest.</p>

<p>"Is that the way you do?" she said to
Mildred. "Don told me that was your way,
and I believe, as he says, it is better than
mine."</p>

<p>"What is yours?" asked Mildred, resuming
the sewing she had dropped on Percy's
fall.</p>

<p>"Oh, I've always made a fuss over my
boy's hurts, pitied him, and blamed the chair,
or table, or whatever he had struck against, for
hurting him, and have pretended to punish
it, just to take his attention from his hurt and
so stop his crying."</p>

<p>"Are you not afraid of teaching him to
be selfish and revengeful?" Mildred asked,
with a look of grave concern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"I never thought of that, and am afraid it
may," said Zillah frankly. "I shall not do
so any more."</p>

<p>Annis was laying herself out for the entertainment
of her little nephews. Presently she
came with a request. "The boys want me to
take them out to the garden to play horse.
May I?"</p>

<p>"I have no objection to Percy's going,"
said Mildred; "the fresh air will be very
good for him, I think, as well as the exercise."</p>

<p>"But I don't want Stuart to go," Zillah
said; "he has a bad cold, and ought to be kept
in the house. Slip away from him if you can,
Annis, for if he sees you and Percy start out
he'll scream himself sick. Or if not himself,
other people," she added with a laugh.</p>

<p>"I'll do my best, but you will have to engage
his attention for a while," said Annis.</p>

<p>"Yes. Stuart, come here; mamma wants
to speak to you."</p>

<p>"No; me's doin' out; p'ay horse wis
Percy," the child returned, with a scowl and a
shake of his little shoulders.</p>

<p>Zillah put down her sewing, rose, and
went to him. "Come with mamma, pet,"
she said in coaxing tones, stooping down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
caress and fondle him. "Don't you want to
go out to the kitchen and see what Celestia
Ann is doing?"</p>

<p>"No, me <em>don't</em>; me's doin' out-doors to
p'ay horse wis Percy," shouted the child defiantly,
quite seeing through the artifice.</p>

<p>Zillah began to grow impatient. "No,
you are not," she said peremptorily; "you
cannot play out of doors at all to-day, because
you have a bad cold, and it would make you
sick."</p>

<p>"I will! I <em>will</em>! I <em>will</em>!" screamed the
child, stamping his foot at her and clenching
his tiny fist. "Ope de door dis minute,
naughty mamma. I <em>will</em> doe out p'ay horse."</p>

<p>There was something comical in his baby
rage, and unfortunately Zillah could not refrain
from laughing, though the other ladies
looked on in grave concern.</p>

<p>Her mirth had not a happy effect upon the
little rebel. Bursting from her grasp, he ran
toward the door just closing on Annis and
Percy, screaming at the top of his voice,
"Let me doe wis you, Annis! Ope de door,"
pounding on it with his fists, then taking hold
of the knob and trying to turn it for himself.</p>

<p>"You bad boy, I'm ashamed of you,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Zillah said, taking his hand, which he instantly
snatched away; "stop this screaming,
or I'll take you home."</p>

<p>"No; sha'n't doe home. Me's doin' out
p'ay horse wis Percy."</p>

<p>"I do believe he's the most persistent
child I ever saw or that ever was made!" Zillah
exclaimed with angry impatience, apparently
addressing the company in general. "I
wonder if it would hurt him to go out for a
little while if I wrap him up well. Do you
think it would, mother?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps not physically, Zillah," Mrs.
Keith answered, with look and tone of grave
disapproval, "but morally it certainly would
have a very bad effect; you have told him
positively that he shall not go out to play to-day,
and if you break your word how can you
expect him ever to esteem his mother a perfectly
truthful woman?"</p>

<p>"You make a very serious matter of it,
mother," Zillah said, reddening.</p>

<p>"It is a very serious thing, my dear
daughter," Mrs. Keith answered, in her own
sweet, gentle way, and with a look of loving
sympathy.</p>

<p>She would have said more, but Stuart at
that instant renewed the screams he had ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
for a moment, upon perceiving symptoms
of relenting on his mother's part.</p>

<p>But Zillah now felt that for very shame
she must remain firm. She tried the old plan
of coaxing and wheedling&mdash;offered picture-books,
stories, candy&mdash;but nothing would do
except the forbidden pleasure, and at length,
losing all patience, she took him into another
room and gave him the punishment Don
would have liked to prescribe on a former occasion.
Then she cried over him while he
sobbed himself to sleep in her arms.</p>

<p>Having laid him on a bed, covered him
carefully, and left a tender kiss on his cheek,
she went back to the sitting-room where the
others were.</p>

<p>Sitting down by her mother's side she
took up her sewing, and tried to go on with it,
but her hands trembled and tears dimmed her
sight. She dropped the work to wipe them
away.</p>

<p>"O mother," she said in quivering tones,
"what shall I do with that child? I can
never bring him up right, as you have
brought up all yours."</p>

<p>"It is a great work, dear, to train up a
child in the way he should go," Mrs. Keith
answered in sympathizing tones; "and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
wisest of us may well ask, 'Who is sufficient
for these things?' yet rejoice and take courage
in the assurance that 'our sufficiency is of
God.' Do not forget His gracious promise,
'If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of
God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
not; and it shall be given him.'</p>

<p>"Whatever success I may have had in
bringing up my children aright has been given
me in answer to prayer and in fulfilment of
that promise."</p>

<p>"I love him so dearly I can hardly bear
to refuse him anything," sighed Zillah, wiping
her eyes and resuming her work.</p>

<p>"I hope, daughter, that you love him
well enough to give yourself the pain of refusing
him hurtful indulgences," was her
mother's grave response. "It often requires
deeper, truer love to deny than to grant, to
punish than to let slip; but 'a child left to
himself bringeth his mother to shame.'"</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, I know that is Bible truth,
and I do not intend to leave mine to himself.
I do really earnestly desire to bring him up
for God and heaven, faulty as my training
has been, I fear, thus far. But he is so young
yet; it seems so hard to discipline such a mere
baby."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it does, my dear child&mdash;I have
not forgotten my own experience&mdash;but I assure
you you will spare much suffering to both
him and yourself by beginning early the lesson
that parental authority is to be respected, and
prompt and cheerful obedience rendered.</p>

<p>"Be very gentle with him, giving your
directions in the form of requests rather than
commands, unless it becomes necessary to
order him. I think children should be treated
with consideration and politeness as well as
grown people; it is the best way to teach them
to be polite and considerate toward others."</p>

<p>"It was your way of teaching us, mother,"
remarked Mildred, with an affectionate, smiling
glance into her mother's sweet, placid
face.</p>

<p>"And a very effectual one it has proved
in their case," remarked Miss Stanhope.</p>

<p>"I think it has," said Mrs. Keith; then
went on: "There is another thing, my
two dear daughters, that I wish to impress
upon you: it is the paramount importance of
always keeping your word with your children.
Try not to make hasty promises or threats,
which you may regret having to carry out;
but having once passed your word, let nothing
induce you to be false to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"I need scarcely urge upon you the importance
of being always entirely truthful with
them, since you know how severely the Scriptures
condemn any, even the slightest, departure
from truth."</p>

<p>"I should hope not, indeed, mother," said
Zillah. "I know I have not always been
firm with my boy, have sometimes let him
gain his wishes&mdash;which I have at first denied&mdash;by
persistent fretting and crying, and have
often too coaxed when I ought to have demanded
obedience; but I have never tried to
secure his obedience by deceiving or telling
him what was not true."</p>

<p>"It is surprising what very lax ideas
many persons&mdash;yes, even some who profess
to be Christians&mdash;have in regard to that
thing," remarked Miss Stanhope. "Shrinking
from the exertion or the pain of enforcing
obedience by legitimate means, they resort to
subterfuge, prevarication, or even downright
falsehood.</p>

<p>"I have heard a mother say to her refractory
or crying child, 'If you don't come into
the house now a big black bear will catch
you;' or, 'If you don't stop that screaming
a dog will come and bite you.'</p>

<p>"Besides that, they will utter threats they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
have not the remotest intention of carrying
out, a fact which the little ones are not slow
to discover and act upon."</p>

<p>At this point the conversation was interrupted
by a call from two neighbors. It
was of unfashionable length, and the talk ran
principally upon housekeeping, children, and
servants.</p>

<p>One of the callers, an elderly lady, had
several little anecdotes to tell of the smart
sayings and doings of her grandchildren; one
of them so aptly illustrating Miss Stanhope's
recent remarks that Mildred and Zillah could
not refrain from a furtive exchange of significant
glances. This was the narrative that
drew them forth.</p>

<p>"Two of my grandchildren were staying
at our house last week&mdash;Mary Bronson, my
son's daughter&mdash;she's ten years old&mdash;and
Tommy Linn, my oldest daughter's child,
he's about five, and has a great notion of being
a man; he's out of petticoats now, and you
couldn't punish him worse than by making
him put them on again.</p>

<p>"Well, the second night he was with us
I was in a quandary. His night-gown had
been hung out to air, and a shower had come
up and made it soaking wet, for you see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
nobody had thought to bring it in, and his
mother had sent only one.</p>

<p>"When Tommy saw the condition it was
in he spoke right up: 'Grandmother, don't
you give me a girl's night-gown, 'cause I
sha'n't wear it. I want to have a man's.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said, 'so you shall. Mary,
you go and get one of his Uncle Sam's for
him.' Then I whispered to her, 'Bring one
of yours.'</p>

<p>"So she brought it, and as I shook it out
Tommy looked at it very suspiciously. 'Is
that a man's?' he says.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' says I, 'it's one of your Uncle
Sam's.' So he let me put it on him, and went
off to sleep as quiet and contented as could
be."</p>

<p>"But do you think it was right?" asked
Miss Stanhope in a tone of gentle remonstrance.
"It was not the truth you told the
child."</p>

<p>"No," acknowledged Mrs. Bronson reluctantly,
"but what is a body to do? You
have to manage children somehow, and if I
hadn't deceived him, there'd have been a regular
battle. What would you have done in
my place?"</p>

<p>"Anything, I hope, rather than tell an untruth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
to one child and give a lesson in falsehood
and deception to the other. Excuse an
old woman's plain speaking, but how can you
ever tell that little Mary that lying is a great
sin&mdash;a sin that must cost the loss of the soul
if unrepented of and unforsaken? or how
blame her if she, at some future day, puts your
lesson in practice to deceive you, perchance
in some matter of vital importance to you or
herself?"</p>

<p>There was silence in the room for some
moments, while Mrs. Bronson sat looking extremely
uncomfortable; then she said, with
an attempt to speak lightly, "You make a
very serious matter of it, Miss Stanhope."</p>

<p>"It <em>is</em> a serious matter," returned Aunt
Wealthy, "as I am sure you will acknowledge
upon thoughtful consideration. I am
sorry to cause you mental disquiet, but 'faithful
are the wounds of a friend,' the wise man
says."</p>

<p>"That is true, and I dare say you are
right. I shall think over what you have been
saying," Mrs. Bronson returned, rising to
take leave.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it all?" she asked
her companion as they left the house.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid the old lady was right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
Sarah, though I own I never thought of it in
that light before&mdash;telling fibs to children to
keep them from misbehaving, I mean. I've
done it occasionally myself, but I don't think
I ever shall again. As she said, how can we
expect them to speak the truth if we are not
always careful to do it ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Annis," Mildred called to her sister,
"please bring Percy in now; it is growing
too late for him to be out."</p>

<p>"He doesn't want to come," was the answer;
"can't he stay out a little longer?"</p>

<p>"No; the sun is near setting, and the air
is growing quite cold," Mildred answered,
running down into the garden and taking her
little boy by the hand. "Come, son, we
must go in now, for mamma does not want
her dear baby to get sick."</p>

<p>"No; won't get sick," he asserted in the
most positive manner. "P'ease, mamma, let
Percy tay wee 'ittle bit longer."</p>

<p>"No, darling; but if it is a good day to-morrow
you shall have a nice long play and
a drive in the carriage with papa and mamma,
beside."</p>

<p>She was leading him gently on toward the
house while she spoke. The child did not
resist, but he set up a loud wail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>"My little boy must not be naughty,"
Mildred said, in a gently reproving tone.</p>

<p>Still the crying continued, and indeed increased
in violence as she led him over the
threshold into the hall. There she stopped,
and stooping down to take off his out-door
garments, "Percy," she said firmly, "you
must stop this noise at once. Mamma is very
sorry her little boy is so naughty. Now be
good, and we will go into the parlor to see
dear grandma and the rest, and you may get
up on a chair by the window and watch for
grandpa, and papa, and Uncle Wallace to come
to supper. They'll be coming pretty soon,
and then we will have our supper, and after
that Percy shall go to his nice little bed."</p>

<p>Being of a pleasant disposition, and having
already learned by experience that nothing
was ever gained from his mother by fretting,
crying, or teasing, the little fellow presently
ceased his wailing, allowed her to dry his
eyes, gave her a kiss and a promise to be good,
and was so for the rest of his stay at his grandfather's.</p>

<p>Zillah had watched the little scene with interest,
and had not failed to note the fact that
Don's report of Mildred's management was
correct; that she did not caress and fondle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
her child while he was misbehaving, but treated
him in a way to make it evident to him
that his conduct was displeasing to her.</p>

<p>At the tea-table there was again an illustration
of the difference in the training the
two children were receiving. Percy was
given only plain, wholesome food suited to
his infant years. Stuart, refusing to be content
with that, was permitted to eat cake, preserves,
meat&mdash;in fact, everything upon the table
to which he chose to take a fancy.</p>

<p>"Is that the way you feed your child?"
the doctor asked in a tone of surprise quite
unmingled with approval.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Wallace carelessly, "he
eats whatever we do; we let him have anything
on the table that he fancies. You don't
think it the best plan, I see."</p>

<p>"No; unless your object is to make an
invalid of him."</p>

<p>"I couldn't bear to eat dainties without
giving my child a share!" exclaimed Zillah
with some heat. "And it never hurts him."</p>

<p>"I think you are mistaken there," said
the doctor; "that such indulgence does not
immediately result in violent illness is no
proof that it does no harm. I am afraid you
will discover one day, when it is too late, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
very serious harm has been done. There is
great danger that his digestive organs will
give way under the great strain put upon
them, and if you do not lose him, you will
have him a sufferer for life."</p>

<p>Zillah looked startled and alarmed, while
Wallace, turning to her, said, "If that's the
case, little wife, we must promptly turn over
a new leaf with him. I'm afraid Charlie has
the right of it; you know how restless Stuart
is often at night, and I dare say it's all owing
to our foolish habit of indulging him in eating
rich and unwholesome food."</p>

<p>"I suppose so; I begin to think I am not
fit to have a child," Zillah said half impatiently,
half sadly, "for my management so
far seems to have been all blunders."</p>

<p>"Live and learn, daughter," her father
said cheerily; "don't be disheartened, but
set about correcting your mistakes as fast as
possible. I don't think," he added, patting
Stuart's head, "that my namesake grandson
is quite ruined yet. Do you, Uncle
Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Oh no, indeed!" replied the doctor;
"he's a fine little fellow, and I want him to
have a chance to continue such, physically as
well as otherwise."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>"It shall not be his father's fault if he
doesn't," said Wallace.</p>

<p>"Nor his mother's," added Zillah.
"Wallace, we would rather live on very plain
fare ourselves than have our boy injured with
rich living, wouldn't we?"</p>

<p>"Certainly; but perhaps that need not be
the only alternative," he answered, with a
good-humored smile.</p>

<p>"I'm sure I don't want to have a battle
with him at every meal," she said disconsolately.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that may be avoided by sending
him to his play before bringing on objectionable
dishes," said her husband.</p>

<small>ELSIE AND HER BROTHER.</small></h2>


<p class="mt2">"Horace, bring papa that newspaper that
lies on the table yonder," Mr. Dinsmore said
to his little son.</p>

<p>The child, seated in his own little chair by
his mother's side, was listlessly turning the
leaves of a picture-book. Elsie had just finished
her recitations for the morning, and was
now sitting on the other side of Rose, taking
a lesson in fancy-work.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore had spoken in a pleasant
tone, rather of request than command, yet
Horace, though usually ready to obey promptly
and cheerfully, sat perfectly still, as if he
had not heard, or did not choose to heed.</p>

<p>"Horace, do you hear me? Go and
bring me that paper," said his father; and
this time the tone was one of stern command.</p>

<p>The child's face instantly assumed a stubborn,
sullen expression, while he neither
moved nor answered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Elsie, pale and trembling with apprehension,
gave him an entreating, her father an
imploring look, which neither seemed to see.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore was regarding his son with
a look of stern displeasure, and Horace's eyes
were on his book.</p>

<p>"Horace, dear, do as papa bids you," said
Rose, with gentle entreaty.</p>

<p>"Leave him to me, Rose," said her husband;
"I have given the order, and I am
the one to enforce it. Horace, obey me instantly
or I shall whip you till you do."</p>

<p>At that stern sentence Elsie almost cried
out in fear and dismay, for well she knew her
father's indomitable will, and she could perceive
that Horace, whom she so dearly loved,
that to see him suffer pain was far worse than
to have it inflicted upon herself, was just now
in a most stubborn, refractory mood.</p>

<p>Probably the state of the atmosphere had
something to do with it, for it was a rainy
day, close and sultry.</p>

<p>"Me don't want to," muttered the little
fellow, making no movement to obey; then
as he felt a not very gentle grasp upon his
arm, "Me won't!" he cried, with a defiant
look upon his father's face.</p>

<p>Mr. Dinsmore instantly administered a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
pretty severe chastisement, Rose sitting by
pale and sad, Elsie with the tears streaming
over her cheeks.</p>

<p>Horace cried violently, but still refused
obedience to the reiterated command, "Go
and get that paper and bring it to me."</p>

<p>The punishment was repeated with added
severity, but he stubbornly persisted in his refusal,
and the battle went on till his mother,
unable to endure the sight, rose and left the
room, and Elsie so far forgot herself in her
darling little brother's pain that she ran to
the rescue, threw her arms about him, and
tried to drag him away from her father.</p>

<p>"Oh, papa, don't!" she sobbed; "please
don't whip him any more! I cannot bear it."</p>

<p>"Elsie! how dare you!" Mr. Dinsmore
exclaimed, in astonishment and wrath, putting
her forcibly aside as he spoke. "Leave
the room instantly," he added, in his sternest
tones and with a stamp of his foot.</p>

<p>She let go her hold of the child, but, lingering,
began again her entreaty, "Oh, papa,
please&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Will you compel me to punish you in
the same way?" he said, again stamping his
foot and pointing significantly to the door.</p>

<p>At that she hastened from the room and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
sought her own, crying as if her heart would
break.</p>

<p>Horace yielded at last, when nearly exhausted
with the conflict, received a kiss of
reconciliation from his father, was then carried
to his mother, and wept himself to sleep in
her arms, her tears falling almost as fast as
his.</p>

<p>She had laid him in his crib and was bending
over him, tenderly smoothing back the
damp curls from his heated brow, when her
husband came softly to her side, and, putting
his arm about her waist, asked in low, moved
tones, "Do you blame me, my Rose? Do
you think me a cruel father?"</p>

<p>She did not answer for a moment, but
seemed struggling with emotion.</p>

<p>He sighed deeply.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I think you were conscientious in it
all," she said at length, her voice tremulous
with feeling, "and that after beginning the
conflict it was necessary for you to conquer;
but I think the beginning it was a sad mistake."</p>

<p>"How do you mean? What would you
have had me do when my child refused to
obey a command so simple and easy to understand
and do?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>"My husband," she said, allowing him to
lead her to a sofa, where they sat down side
by side, "I do not like to seem to try to teach
you who are so much older and wiser than I;
but do you not think you would have spared
yourself and all of us a great deal of pain if
instead of compelling obedience you had simply
punished refusal to obey, and there let the
matter rest?"</p>

<p>"Would it have gone as far toward securing
obedience in the future?" he queried,
rather as if considering the question himself
than asking her opinion.</p>

<p>"I think so," she said. "Surely a child
will not be apt to disobey very often when he
finds that swift punishment is always meted
out in proportion to the magnitude of the
offence."</p>

<p>He sat silently meditating for some little
time, she anxiously watching the expression
of his face.</p>

<p>At length, turning to her, "I believe you
are right, my love," he said, "and I shall, if
possible, avoid such conflicts in the future, as
you advise, simply punishing the act of disobedience,
or refusal to obey. To-day that
course would, as you have suggested, have
saved us all a great deal of suffering; and oh,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
what would it not have saved to Elsie and
myself if put into practice years ago!" He
sighed deeply as he added, "And the pain
occasioned by this unfortunate conflict is not
all over yet, for I have her to punish now."</p>

<p>"Elsie?" exclaimed Rose, looking at him
in great surprise; "what has she done?"</p>

<p>He told her what had occurred just as she
left the room where he was battling with
Horace, adding, "I must, of course, punish
her, for she was not only rebelling against my
authority herself, but upholding her brother
in doing the same."</p>

<p>"I suppose so," said Rose sadly, "but I
wish you could feel it right and wise to forgive
her."</p>

<p>"Not till I have inflicted some punishment,"
he said; "the offence was quite too
serious to be lightly passed over."</p>

<p>"But you will not be severe with her?"
Rose said pleadingly. "You know it was
only her great love for her little brother that
made her for a moment forgetful of her duty
to you. And I am sure she is repenting bitterly
now."</p>

<p>"I have no intention of inflicting corporal
punishment, if that is what you apprehend,"
he said; "but I think I ought to make her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
aware, for a day or two at least, that she is in
disgrace with me."</p>

<p>"I am so sorry," sighed Rose; "for
though to some children that would be a very
slight punishment, I know that to her it will
be positively dreadful."</p>

<p>"Yes," he returned, echoing her sigh,
"she is extravagantly fond of her father's
caresses and endearments, but so is he of
hers, and I doubt if the punishment will be
more severe to the one than to the other of
us."</p>

<p>"What's de mattah, chile? What's de
mattah wid you an' little massa?" Aunt
Chloe asked, with an anxious, troubled look,
as Elsie rushed into her own apartments crying
very bitterly.</p>

<p>Amid heavy sobbing and floods of tears
the little girl related what had passed between
her father and brother, winding up with the
story of her interference and its result.</p>

<p>"Oh, darlin' chile, dat was bad!" exclaimed
Chloe. "You shouldn't neber do no
sich ting as dat! Dat be bery bad ting fo'
little massa, what you been an' gone an' done.
De Bible say chillens mus' min' dere fader
and mudder."</p>

<p>Elsie made no reply, but throwing herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
on a couch, half buried her face in a pillow in
the effort to shut out the sound of Horace's
cries, which penetrated even there.</p>

<p>Until they ceased she scarcely thought of
anything but that he was being hurt; but
when all grew quiet with the ending of the
conflict, she was suddenly struck with the
enormity of her offence and the dread certainty
that her father was greatly and justly
incensed at her unwarrantable interference between
him and her brother.</p>

<p>She was astonished at her own temerity,
and trembled at thought of the probable consequences.
That some sort of punishment
would be meted out to her she had not the
slightest doubt, and as her father was wont to
be prompt in action, she fully expected a visit
from him as soon as he was done disciplining
Horace.</p>

<p>She listened with a quaking heart for the
sound of his approaching footsteps; but the
minutes and the hours crept on and he came
not.</p>

<p>The dinner-bell rang, and Elsie started up
full of perplexity and alarm, doubting whether
she was or was not expected to obey its summons.</p>

<p>"Oh, mammy," she cried, "I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
know what to do! I don't want to go to the
table. Please go and ask papa if I may be
excused. Tell him my head aches, for indeed
it does, and I'm not at all hungry."</p>

<p>"Co'se, chile, co'se you's got misery in
de head after all dat cryin'," replied Aunt
Chloe, putting down her knitting to go and
do the errand. "Don' cry no mo', honey;
maybe massa forgib you, ef you's right down
sorry."</p>

<p>"I am sorry, mammy," sobbed Elsie;
"oh, I am very sorry; but I know that papa
will punish me somehow or other, and I deserve
it."</p>

<p>"Maybe not, honey," responded Aunt
Chloe cheerfully, then hurried away to the
dining-room.</p>

<p>She returned in a few minutes, bringing a
very nice meal daintily arranged on a silver
waiter.</p>

<p>"What did papa say?" asked Elsie anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not much, honey; only, 'Bery well,
Aunt Chloe, you kin take her something
when she feels inclined to eat.'"</p>

<p>Elsie's tears burst forth afresh. Was it
then a matter of indifference to her father that
she was in pain? her father, who was usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
so full of loving anxiety at the slightest indication
of anything being amiss with her?</p>

<p>"Oh, mammy," she sobbed, "what if
papa shouldn't ever love me any more!"</p>

<p>"Ki, chile, dat a heap ob nonsense you's
talkin' now!" laughed Chloe. "Massa
couldn't neber help it; not a bit; you's jes'
de light ob his eyes. Dere now, don' cry no
mo', but jes' eat what your ole mammy fotch
fo' you."</p>

<p>There was some slight and temporary comfort
in the assurance her mammy expressed,
and the little girl found herself able, by its
help, to eat sparingly of the dainties she had
brought her.</p>

<p>"Did papa say I must stay in my rooms
till I got permission to leave them?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"No, honey, darlin', he didn't say nuffin'
't all 'bout dat; didn't gib no corrections,
but jes' 'bout gibin' you what you wants to
eat when you's ready fo' it. Dat don' soun'
so mighty bad fo' yo' case, chile, an' I respects
mass'll be comin' in 'rectly fo' to kiss
an' make up."</p>

<p>"No," Elsie said, shaking her head and
bursting into tears again, "he'll punish me
first; I am quite sure of that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ki, chile! ef he gwine fo' to do dat,
what you 'spose he waitin' fo'?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," sobbed the little girl;
"but I'm afraid it will be a long while before
he will pet and fondle me again, or even give
me a kind look or word."</p>

<p>"Why you tink dat, honey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because he looked so stern and
angry when he stamped his foot at me and
ordered me out of the room."</p>

<p>The afternoon passed very slowly in the
constant yet vain expectation of a visit from
her father or a summons to his presence.
Several times she was on the point of venturing
into it without being called, but her
heart failed her; she was not sure that it
might not be looked upon as an additional
offence; he had sent her out of the room
without saying how long he meant her banishment
to last.</p>

<p>Besides, she wanted to be sure of seeing
him alone; she would not have even Rose a
witness of the interview.</p>

<p>So she waited till the hour when the latter
would be engaged in seeing little Horace put
to bed for the night, then in much trepidation
went in search of her father. She felt quite
sure of finding him alone, for there were no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
guests in the house, and as it was still storming,
there seemed no danger of any one calling.</p>

<p>She went first to the parlor, which was
their principal family room when alone. Yes,
there he was, sitting in an easy-chair by a
window, his back toward her, doubtless reading,
and quite alone.</p>

<p>She stole noiselessly to the back of his
chair, her heart beating very fast and loud.
She almost thought he must hear it; but he
seemed unaware of her approach, entirely absorbed
in his book.</p>

<p>She caught hold of the chair-back to
steady and support herself, for she was trembling
in every limb.</p>

<p>"Papa, I&mdash;" she began, her voice full of
tears.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to say to you, Miss Dinsmore,
except that I forbid you to address me
by that title or to call me father, or to take
any liberties with me that would be unsuitable
in a stranger guest in the house," he interrupted,
in a freezing tone, without turning
toward her, and with his eyes still upon his
book.</p>

<p>"Oh, I can't bear it! I <em>can't</em> bear it!"
she cried, with a burst of sobs and tears,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
throwing herself at his feet. "I know I've
behaved very badly, but I'm&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Get up," he said sternly, again interrupting
her; "control yourself, or leave the
room till you can."</p>

<p>His look was as stern and cold as his
words.</p>

<p>She struggled to her feet and went back to
her own rooms, crying very bitterly.</p>

<p>"Oh, mammy, mammy," she sobbed,
"it's even worse than I expected, for I'm
forbidden to call him father or papa. Oh,
what shall I do? How can I call him anything
else? And I mustn't hug or kiss him
or sit on his knee; and&mdash;and he called me
'Miss Dinsmore.' Just think of it! Not
even Elsie, without the pet names I love so to
hear from his lips, but Miss Dinsmore, as if I
were a stranger he cared nothing about."</p>

<p>"'Tain't gwine to las' long, honey darlin',
dat ar ain't," said Chloe soothingly, taking
the weeper in her arms and caressing her
tenderly; "you' jes' de light ob massa's
eyes, like I tole you befo', an' de pet names
be sho' to come again fo' long. 'Sides, you'll
hab yo' ole seat on massa's knee, an' all de
hugs and kisses you wants."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid not for a long while, mammy,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
sobbed the little girl. "I think papa
has not been so displeased with me since that
dreadful time, so long ago, when we lived at
Roselands."</p>

<p>The tea-bell rang.</p>

<p>"Is you gwine to de table, darlin'?"
Chloe asked.</p>

<p>"Oh no, no, mammy!" Elsie exclaimed,
with a fresh burst of grief; "papa bade me
leave the room till I could control myself, and
I know I could not do that in his presence
yet; oh, how can I ever be with him and not
call him father or papa?"</p>

<p>As they sat down to the table Rose glanced
at the vacant seat, then at her husband. "I
fear the dear child is ill with grief and remorse,
Horace," she said, with a troubled,
anxious look; "she has such a tender conscience,
and so dearly loves the father whose
displeasure she has incurred."</p>

<p>"She is not ill; I saw her a few moments
since," he answered, with a sigh. "She is
distressed, I know, but it is the consequence
of her own wrong-doing, and she must endure
it for a time that she may learn never again
to encourage her brother in resistance to lawful
authority."</p>

<p>"Don't you think the lesson may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
already learned?" Rose said pleadingly.
"She has no stubbornness in her nature, but
is very easily subdued and made penitent."</p>

<p>"I am not so sure of that; she comes of
very stubborn stock, on one side at least," he
replied, with a rather melancholy attempt at
pleasantry.</p>

<p>"My dear husband, I wish you would forgive
her," pleaded the young step-mother.
"Surely you will before she goes to bed to-night?"</p>

<p>"Can you not be content to leave her to
me, my Rose?" he asked. "Do you not know
that I am a most doting father? that she is the
very light of my eyes, and core of my heart?
Ah, I sometimes fear she is her father's idol."</p>

<p>"No," Rose said, half-chokingly, and
with tears in her eyes, "I am sure your conscience
need not trouble you on that score so
long as you can find it in your heart to be so
severe with her faults."</p>

<p>"Not in my heart, love," he returned, a
little hurt, "but in the settled conviction that
I am acting for her good. It requires a
strong effort of my will to resist the promptings
of affection; love that urges me to send
for her at once, tell her she is forgiven, and
lavish the tenderest caresses upon her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just what I should rejoice to see
you do," said Rose.</p>

<p>"To-morrow or next day perhaps you
may," he answered, in a tone that seemed to
imply that he wished to hear no more on the
subject. And Rose, like the wise woman and
affectionate wife that she was, dropped it,
though her heart ached for Elsie.</p>

<p>After they had left the dining-room for
the parlor, she asked if she might go to the
little girl's apartments and see if she were
feeling quite well.</p>

<p>"I really don't like to claim so much authority
over my wife as to forbid her going
where she will about my house, which is her
own also," he said, with a slight smile, "but
I should prefer to have the child left to herself
for the present. I have not confined her
to her rooms, and she can join us when she
will. I only bade her leave my presence this
afternoon till she could control herself; and
she would understand from that that she was
at liberty to return to it when ready to comply
with the condition."</p>

<p>"How she will miss her good-night chat
seated upon her father's knee; the good-night
hug and kiss he has been wont to bestow upon
her!" sighed Rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," he said, in a moved tone, rising
and beginning to pace the room in a disturbed
way, "she will hardly know what to do without
them; nor shall I; but we must. Don't
make any further efforts to shake my resolve,
Rose, for I cannot, must not, pass lightly over
so serious a misdemeanor as she has been
guilty of in this instance."</p>

<p>Rose could but comply with his wishes,
so plainly and strongly expressed, and Elsie
passed the evening alone, except for the companionship
of her nurse; for she dared not
trust herself again in her father's presence till
she could hope to be able to maintain the self-control
he required.</p>

<p>As her hour for retiring drew near, Aunt
Chloe noted how she was listening for approaching
footsteps, at the same time glancing
frequently at her watch or the clock on the
mantel.</p>

<p>"Sho, honey, you's gwine to de parlor to
say good-night fo' you goes to bed?" she remarked
inquiringly.</p>

<p>Elsie shook her head, the tears rolling
down her cheeks. "How can I, mammy,
when I mustn't say father or papa?" she
sobbed. "I couldn't without crying, if at
all; and papa forbade me his presence till I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
could control myself. There, my bedtime has
come, and papa hasn't. Oh, I could hardly
help hoping he did not mean to let me go to
bed unforgiven. There's never been a night
before since&mdash;since those dreadful days at
Roselands, that I've gone without his kiss, or
without being held close to his heart with
tender, loving words as if I were the dearest
thing to him in all the world."</p>

<p>"Don't you go for to fret yo' po' heart
out, blessed chile," Chloe said, taking her
nursling in her kind arms. "Yo' ole mammy
lubs you like her life; so does yo' pa
too; an' maybe he's gwine come in hyah
'bout de time you's ready fo' bed, to kiss an'
make up ef you promises neber to do so no
mo' as you been an' gone an' done dis hyah
mornin'."</p>

<p>"Oh no, never, never!" Elsie sobbed,
hiding her face for a moment on Aunt Chloe's
shoulder. "I don't know how I ever dared
to do it! I deserve to be punished very
severely; no wonder papa is so displeased
with me."</p>

<p>She was soon in bed, but did not, as usual
with her, fall asleep at once; she lay for a
good while listening to every sound, hoping
even against hope that her father would relent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
and come to give her his forgiveness and a
loving kiss ere she slept; but he did not, and
at length she cried herself to sleep. It was
the same thing over again in the morning;
she hoped he would come to her to inquire of
her penitence and good resolutions for the
future, or send for her to go to him; but she
waited and wished in vain, breakfasted in her
own rooms&mdash;still too distrustful of her power
of self-control to venture to join her parents
in the breakfast-room&mdash;then prepared her task
for the day; yet could not find courage to
carry them to her father that he might hear
her recitations.</p>

<p>She was glad the weather continued such
as to keep visitors away; she hoped none
would come till this trouble of hers was over;
for how could she bear to have any one out of
the family&mdash;even good, kind Mr. Travilla&mdash;know
that she had so displeased her father?
And while his displeasure lasted, how impossible
it would be for any guest to fail to perceive
it.</p>

<p>She tried one employment after an other&mdash;needlework,
reading, music&mdash;but found no
interest in any of them, and every now and
then she would give way to a fit of violent
weeping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh," she said to herself, "how long is
it to last? Papa did not say, and I don't
know when he will think I have been punished
enough."</p>

<p>So the day wore wearily away, and night
came again without any change for the better.</p>

<p>Sadly mourning over her estrangement
from her father, and longing inexpressibly for
his forgiveness and loving favor, a thought
struck her.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," she said half aloud, "I will
write to papa the confession and plea for pardon
he would not let me speak."</p>

<p>Opening her writing-desk, she selected a
sheet of paper, took up her pen and dipped it
in the ink; but, alas, how should she begin
her note? By what title address the father
who had forbidden her to call him that?
How impossible to call him anything else!
How disrespectful, how impertinent to omit a
title altogether!</p>

<p>She laid down her pen, pushed the paper
aside, and covering her face with her hands,
wept long and bitterly, Chloe watching her
with tear-dimmed eyes.</p>

<p>"Precious chile," she said at length,
"what kin yo' ole mammy do fo' her pet?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, mammy, unless you could persuade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
my father to forgive and love me
again."</p>

<p>"Po' dear, he'll do dat befo' long; I'se
pow'ful sure ob dat. Massa so fond ob you
he kaint hole out much longer hisself. Was
you gwine write sumfin' to massa, honey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I can't, because he forbade me
to call him father or papa, and&mdash;and oh, I
don't know how to call him anything else.
Oh, mammy, I don't believe I can sleep at all
to-night without his forgiveness!"</p>

<p>"Den 'spose my chile go an' ax massa fo'
it."</p>

<p>"No, I dare not, because he forbade me
to take any greater liberty with him than a
stranger guest might, or to come into his presence
till I could be calm; and I know I could
not yet."</p>

<p>"Den yo' ole mammy gwine fo' you; an'
dis am de bes' time, kase I s'pect massa by
hisself in de parlor," she said, rising and leaving
the room.</p>

<p>As she had expected, she found Mr. Dinsmore
alone in the parlor. Dropping a courtesy,
she stood before him with folded hands,
waiting in respectful silence for an invitation
to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, Aunt Chloe, what is it?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Massa, my chile frettin' herself sick."</p>

<p>"She must not do that," he said, with a
touch of sternness in his tone.</p>

<p>"Please, sah, s'pose my chile kaint help
it?"</p>

<p>"She must help it. Tell her I say so."</p>

<p>"Oh, massa, ain't you gwine forgib my
chile? She am mighty sorry she been an'
gone an' done such t'ing; she ain't neber
gwine do de like ob dat no mo'."</p>

<p>"I trust not," he said; "I shall have to
be very severe with her if she does. No, I
am not ready to forgive her yet. Such conduct
as she has been guilty of cannot be
passed over with a trifling punishment. She
must be made to realize that her offence is a
very serious one."</p>

<p>A wave of his hand with the last word
gave Chloe to understand that the interview
was at an end.</p>

<p>Elsie's heart beat high betwixt hope and
fear as she sat waiting and listening for
Chloe's returning footsteps, and for her
father's, which might perhaps accompany or
precede them.</p>

<p>"Oh, mammy, what did he say? will he
forgive me? may I go to him now and call
him papa?" she asked, half-breathlessly and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
with an eager, longing look, as her nurse came
in. Then reading the answer in Chloe's sad
and troubled countenance, she dropped her
face into her hands and sobbed aloud.</p>

<p>"Don't, chile; don't, honey darlin'; I'se
sho it all come right befo' long," Chloe said
tenderly, laying her hand caressingly on the
drooping head. "But massa he say you
mus' stop dis frettin' an' cryin'. I tole him
s'pose you couldn't, but he say bery sternly,
'She must.' Kin you do it, darlin'?"</p>

<p>"I'll try; I must obey my father," she
sighed, and lifting her head, wiped away her
tears, and by a strong and determined effort
stopped their flow and suppressed her sobs.</p>

<p>It was now time for her preparations for
bed. She went through them in silence, tears
now and again gathering in her eyes, but
none suffered to fall.</p>

<p>"Papa must be obeyed," she kept repeating
to herself.</p>

<p>She maintained her self-control for some
time after laying her head upon her pillow,
but sleep did not visit it, and as she lay there
turning restlessly from side to side, mental
distress again so overcame her that ere she was
aware of it she was wetting her pillow with
floods of tears and sobbing aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p>It was now Mr. Dinsmore's own hour for
retiring, and he was in his room, the door of
communication with his little daughter's bedroom
open as usual, so that the sound of her
weeping came very distinctly to his ear.</p>

<p>The next moment Elsie felt herself lifted
from the bed and set upon her feet; then her
hand was taken in a close clasp and she led
into the adjoining room, her own dressing-room.</p>

<p>Here the moon shone brightly in at a window,
in front of which stood an easy-chair.
Toward that her father led her, and seating
himself therein was about to draw her to his
knee; but she fell at his feet sobbing, "Pa&mdash;oh,
I can't help forgetting and calling you
that, or crying because you are angry with me;
but I don't want to be disobedient, and I'm
so, so sorry for all my naughtiness. Please,
please forgive me; please let me call you
father, or my heart will break!"</p>

<p>"You may. I remove the prohibition,"
he said, in a moved tone, lifting her up and
drawing her to his breast; "and if you are
indeed very penitent on account of your very
bad behavior yesterday, and promise never to
do such a thing again, I will forgive and receive
you back into favor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear father, thank you," she sobbed,
clinging about his neck. "I think I was
never so sorry in all my life, and I am quite
resolved never, never to do such a thing
again; I am astonished at myself to think I
ever dared to do it."</p>

<p>"So am I," he said; "and I am afraid
you are hardly yet fully sensible of the enormity
of your offence. I want you to reflect
that in that act you were not only guilty of
high-handed rebellion yourself, but were encouraging
and upholding your brother in the
same. Do you wonder that I have felt it my
painful duty to punish you with some severity?"</p>

<p>"No, papa," she answered humbly, "I
feel that I have deserved it all, and a great
deal more. I wonder you didn't whip me too
then and there, that Horace might see how
very naughty you considered my interference,
and that I must obey just the same as he."</p>

<p>"I probably should have done just that
had you been a little younger," he said, "and
I am not altogether sure that I ought to have
suffered you to escape as it was. You may
be very sure," he added gravely and with
some sternness of tone, "that you will not, if
the offence is ever repeated."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, it shall not be, papa, it never, never
shall!" she exclaimed, holding up her face
for a kiss, which he gave very heartily.</p>

<p>"To make sure of that, if you see such a
conflict beginning (though I trust there will
be no more of them), leave the room at once,"
he said.</p>

<p>They were silent for a moment, she with
her head laid on his breast, her arm about his
neck, while he held her close, softly smoothing
the curls back from her brow with the
free hand, and gazing down tenderly into the
little pale face with its tear-swollen eyes.</p>

<p>"My poor darling, you have had a sad
time of it," he remarked presently. "You
have been crying a great deal, I see."</p>

<p>At that her face flushed painfully, and her
lip quivered. "Please, papa, don't be angry,"
she said in tremulous tones. "I tried
to stop as soon as you sent me word that I
must. I didn't shed any more tears till after
I got into bed; but then I was so, so hungry
for my good-night kiss that they would come
in spite of all I could do."</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," he said; "I have forgiven
all your offences, and this is the seal,"
kissing her fondly several times.</p>

<p>"Dear papa, thank you. Oh, how dearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
I do love you! how sweet your caresses are
to me!" she exclaimed. Then after a moment's
silence, "Are mamma and Horace
quite well, papa?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; both would have been in to see
you if their plans had met my approval.
Horace was much concerned when I explained
to him that because his sister was so very
naughty as to try to take him away from me
when I was punishing him for being stubborn
and disobedient, she had to be punished too;
and for that reason he could not see her."</p>

<p>"I am very much ashamed of having set
him so bad an example, papa," she said with
a sob, and blushing deeply.</p>

<p>"It was to neutralize that example, not to
mortify you, that I deemed it necessary to tell
him. Now, my love, my darling, it is high
time you were in bed and asleep," he added,
repeating his caresses; then setting her on
her feet again, he led her back to her bed,
laid her in it, and with a fatherly blessing and
a kiss on lip and cheek and forehead, left her
to her slumbers.</p>

<p>At first she seemed too full of joy and
thankfulness to close an eye; yet ere she was
aware of it the happy waking thoughts had
merged themselves in blissful dreams.</p></div>

<small>CROSSING THE PLAINS.</small></h2>


<p class="mt2">News was several times received from
Rupert and Don during their slow and toilsome
journey across the States of Illinois and
Missouri, but when the last frontier town was
left behind and with it such luxuries of civilization
as mails and post-offices, the door of
communication was closed: they could neither
hear from home nor be heard from there
till the trackless wilderness should be crossed
and the land of golden promise reached.</p>

<p>The Keiths had an ox-team and wagon for
the transportation of their baggage&mdash;clothing,
camp equipage, mining tools, and some luxuries,
among which were a few books. Also a
saddle-horse, which they rode by turns;
though Rupert oftener than Don, who had
more strength for driving and more taste for it.</p>

<p>This emigrant band, of which they formed
a part, comprised some twenty men, several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
with wives and children; a dozen wagons
drawn by oxen, and two or three horses beside
that which was the joint property of Rupert
and Don.</p>

<p>Rupert's health had steadily improved
from the time of leaving home, so that the
bulletins to the dear ones there had been
sources of great joy, though joy mingled with
grief at the thought of the months or perhaps
years that must pass by ere they could hope to
see the loved wanderers again.</p>

<p>Rupert, who was of a very kindly disposition,
always on the lookout for opportunities
to be of service to others, had already become
a general favorite with his fellow-travellers.</p>

<p>Was a little child crying with the weariness
of confinement to the cramped quarters
of the wagon, he would take it on his horse
before him, and give it the rest of a brisk
canter in the open air and with an unobstructed
view on all sides.</p>

<p>Older ones were frequently taken up behind
him; at other times he dismounted, and
joining them as they plodded along beside or
in the rear of the wagons, beguiled the tediousness
of the way with story or song.</p>

<p>So slow was the movement of the oxen, so
wearisome the constant sitting or lying in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
jolting wagons, that a robust child would very
often prefer walking during the greater part
of the day; and even little girls were known
to have walked hundreds of miles in making
the trip across the plains.</p>

<p>But it was necessary to keep near the
wagons because of danger from wild beasts
and roving bands of Indians.</p>

<p>Rupert, and indeed every man in the
party, was always armed ready to repel an attack
or to bring down game that came within
shooting distance, thus adding a welcome
variety to their bill of fare. There were wild
geese and turkeys, prairie fowl, rabbits, squirrels,
deer, bisons, and bears, all to be had for
the shooting.</p>

<p>After leaving Independence they camped
out every night, building a fire to cook their
evening meal and keep off wild beasts, except
when there was reason to fear that Indians
were in the neighborhood; then the fire was
not kindled, as the smoke would be likely to
reveal their vicinity to the lurking foe; but
instead, sentinels were posted, who kept vigilant
watch while the others slept.</p>

<p>Occasionally in the day-time, when no
game had come near, two or three of the men
would mount their horses and gallop away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
over the prairie in search of it, finding it no
very difficult task to overtake the slow-moving
wagon-train, even after a ride of several
miles, and an absence, it might be, of an hour
or more.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when they had been many
weeks passing through that great wilderness,
so that they were now much nearer California
than the homes they had left behind, they
were crossing a seemingly boundless rolling
prairie.</p>

<p>Their provisions were getting low, and
fowls and larger game alike had kept out of
shooting range all day.</p>

<p>"It's five o'clock," Rupert Keith said,
looking at his watch and addressing a man
named Morton, who was riding by his side,
"and will soon be too late for a shot at anything.
Suppose we dash off over those hills
yonder and see if we can't scare up something."</p>

<p>"Agreed," replied Morton. Then called
to another horseman, "Halloo, Smith! will
you join Keith and me in a run over those
hills in search of game?"</p>

<p>"That I will!" was the rejoinder, and
away they galloped, and were in a few moments
lost to the view of the rest of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
party, who continued moving onward in their
accustomed leisurely fashion.</p>

<p>An hour or more had passed; the prairie
still stretched away on every side; the distant
hills to the southward, beyond which the
horsemen had gone, were still in view, and
the eyes of almost every one in the train were
turned ever and anon in that direction, hoping
for their return well-laden with venison
or wild fowl.</p>

<p>At length a shout was raised, "Here they
come!" but was followed instantly by the
affrighted cry, "Indians! Indians!" for a
party of the latter were in full chase.</p>

<p>Don was walking beside his team, two
little girls quite near him. He caught them
up and almost threw them into his wagon,
telling them to lie down and keep quiet and
still; then turned and pulled out a revolver.</p>

<p>Others had acted with equal quickness,
and were ready&mdash;some from their wagons,
some from the ground&mdash;to fire upon the advancing
foe.</p>

<p>There was a brief, sharp fight; the Indians
were driven off, carrying their killed and
wounded with them.</p>

<p>Then it was found that Rupert was missing,
Smith badly wounded, one or two others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
slightly, while Don lay insensible and bleeding
on the ground near his wagon.</p>

<p>They at first thought him dead, but he
had only fainted from loss of blood, and they
presently succeeded in bringing him to.</p>

<p>"Rupert? my brother&mdash;where is he?" he
asked in the first moment of consciousness.</p>

<p>"Those red devils have done for him,
Don," Morton answered, with a tremble in his
voice; "the shot that tumbled him from his
horse was the first intimation we had that
they were upon us."</p>

<p>Don groaned and hid his face.</p>

<p>"Don't take it so hard," said a pitying
woman's voice; "he's gone to a better place;
we all know that; nobody could be with him
a day and not see that he was a real Christian."</p>

<p>"That's so." "True enough, Mrs.
Stone." "I only wish we were all as ready
for heaven," responded one and another.</p>

<p>Then Morton suggested that they ought
to be moving on; the Indians might return
in larger force; it would not do to encamp
where they were, and night was coming on.</p>

<p>To this there was a general assent. Don
was carefully and tenderly lifted into his
wagon and gently laid down upon the softest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
bed that could be improvised for him; then a
volunteer driver from among the young men
of the party took his seat and drove on, doing
his best to make the motion easy to the sufferer.
They were the last of the train, but not
far behind the wagon next in front of them.</p>

<p>In spite of all the care and kindness shown
him, Don's bodily sufferings were acute, yet
by no means equal to his mental distress; his
sense of bereavement&mdash;a bereavement so sudden,
so shocking&mdash;and anguish at the thought
of the poignant grief of his parents when the
dreadful news should reach their ears.</p>

<p>The emigrants pushed on for several hours
before they ventured to stop and encamp.
When at last they did, the cessation of motion
gave some slight relief to poor Don, and the
food brought him by the kind-hearted woman
who had tried to comfort him with the assurance
of his brother's readiness for death, revived
somewhat his failing strength; but it
was a night of pain and grief, in which Don
would have given much to be at home again,
especially if he might have had Rupert there
alive and well.</p>

<p>The night passed quietly; there was no
new alarm, and early in the morning the emigrants
pursued their way, pressing forward as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
rapidly as circumstances would permit, and
keeping a sharp lookout for Indians.</p>

<p>Before they started&mdash;indeed, as soon as he
was awake, Morton came to ask how Don was,
and how he had passed the night.</p>

<p>Don answered briefly, then burst out,
"Oh, Morton, are you quite sure that&mdash;that
my brother was killed? May he not have
been only stunned by the shot and the fall
from his horse?"</p>

<p>Morton shook his head. "No, I looked
back several times, and he never moved."</p>

<p>"Oh," groaned Don, "if only I were
not helpless, I should go and search for him,
for I do not feel at all sure that he is not still
alive."</p>

<p>"Well, I think you may," said Morton;
"for even supposing he was not killed by that
first shot and the fall, the Indians would be
sure to finish him when they went back, for
they went off in that direction."</p>

<p>Don turned away his face with a heavy
sob. It did indeed seem almost impossible
that Rupert could have escaped death, and
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;oh, if he were but able to go
in search of him! Perhaps he was a captive
doomed to death by slow torture. Oh, to fly
to his aid! rescue or perish with him!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>But no one else in all the company thought
there was the least chance that he was alive,
and to go in quest of him would not only
greatly delay them (a great misfortune, considering
the fact that their stock of provisions
was so low), but would risk all their lives, as
the Indians were probably still prowling about
that spot, and might attack them in great
force.</p>

<p>The poor boy's only comfort was, that
wherever and in whatever circumstances his
brother might be, he was under the care of an
almighty Friend, who would never leave nor
forsake him, and in being able to plead for
him with that Friend.</p>

<p>The rest of the journey was of course a
very sad one to poor Don, though every one
was kind to him, doing all that was possible
for his relief and comfort, partly for Rupert's
sake, partly for Don's own, for he too had
ever shown a pleasant, obliging, kindly disposition
toward others.</p>

<p>His wounds had nearly healed, and he had
recovered almost his usual strength by the
time their destination was reached.</p>

<p>Arrived there, he wrote at once to his
parents, telling of Rupert's loss, his own condition,
and asking if they were willing that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
being now upon the ground, he should stay
for a time and look for gold.</p>

<p>But as months must elapse ere he could
hope to receive an answer, he set to work determined
to do his best in the mean time.</p>

<p>He did not find the life a whit less toilsome
and trying than his parents had warned
him it would be, nor were his surroundings
any more agreeable; the roughest of men,
drinking, smoking, swearing, quarrelsome
creatures, were often his daily companions;
the foulest language assailed his ears; gambling
and drunken brawls went on in his presence;
robberies, murders, and lynchings were
of frequent occurrence; the Sabbath was
openly desecrated; men&mdash;even those who had
been all their previous lives accustomed to the
restraints of religion&mdash;here acted as if they
had never heard of God, or heaven, or hell.</p>

<p>And there were few creature comforts to
be had; all the necessaries of life were sold at
astonishingly high prices, so that gold, even
when found, could not be kept, but melted
away like snow in the sun.</p>

<p>It was not long before Don's thoughts
were turned yearningly toward the home he
had been so eager to forsake.</p>

<p>He was tolerably fortunate in his quest:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
but alas! all the gold in the world could not
compensate for the loss of all the sweetness
and beauty of life; all the happiness to be
found in a well-regulated home, where love to
God and man was the ruling principle of action;
where were neatness and order, gentleness
and refinement; where sweet-toned
voices spoke kindly affectionate words; affectionate
smiles were wont to greet his coming,
and loved eyes to look lovingly into his.</p>

<p class="mt2">Many months had passed, bringing no
news from their Westward-bound sons, and,
in spite of their trust in God, Mr. and Mrs.
Keith were often not a little anxious.</p>

<p>Miss Stanhope had returned to her home
in the fall after the boys' departure. Her
pleasant, cheery companionship was much
missed, and but for Mildred and Zillah being
so near, the mother would have seen many a
lonely hour, though she found agreeable occupation
for a part of each day in teaching
Annis, keeping her from school, and constituting
herself her governess.</p>

<p>This took up the morning hours, while the
married daughters were engaged with household
cares and duties; then the afternoons, if
the weather permitted any of them to go
from home, were usually spent together at
one or another of the three houses, the ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
busy with their needles, the children playing
about the room.</p>

<p>Both Mildred's and Zillah's cares were increasing,
for each had now a little daughter;
so that there were four little ones to claim the
love of the grandparents and help to win their
thoughts from the anxious following of the
absent sons; in that way they were proving
great comforts as well as cares.</p>

<p>So the winter slipped quietly away without
any startling event to mark its progress.</p>

<p>But in March Mrs. Keith had an attack of
pneumonia, which greatly alarmed the family
and kept her in bed for a fortnight. She was
about again, but still feeble, and, in consequence
of her weakness of body, more than
ever anxious and distressed about Rupert and
Don, from whom no news had yet been received
since the letter written from Independence
so many, many months ago.</p>

<p>Mildred spent every spare moment with
her mother, doing all in her power for her
comfort of body and to cheer and interest her
and keep her mind from dwelling upon the
absent dear ones.</p>

<p>Dr. Landreth too was exceedingly kind to
his mother-in-law, for whom he had a very
strong and filial affection. He would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
willingly sacrificed his own comfort at any
time for hers, and was more than willing to
have Mildred constantly with her while she
was so feeble and ailing; while all his skill and
medical knowledge were exerted for her
benefit.</p>

<p>One evening Mildred, helping her mother
to bed, remarked, "I wonder what has become
of Charlie; he hasn't been in to see you
this afternoon."</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is an evidence that he
thinks me a great deal better," Mrs. Keith
answered, in a playful tone. Then, more seriously,
"He has been very, very good to me,
Mildred; you must tell him I appreciate his
kindness."</p>

<p>"He knows you do, mother," Mildred
answered; "but indeed it is a real pleasure to
him to do anything in his power for you; he
says you are the only mother he has ever
known, and a very dear and precious one."</p>

<p>"No doubt he would have been in this
afternoon if he had not been prevented. I
fear somebody is very ill."</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mildred, passing out
of the house on her way to her own home,
met her husband at the gate.</p>

<p>He gave her his arm almost without a word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
nor did he speak during their short walk; but
Mildred's thoughts were busy, and she scarcely
noticed his silence.</p>

<p>It was too dark in the street to see his
face, but on entering their own sitting-room,
where a bright light was burning, she caught
sight of it, and its pale, distressed look struck
terror to her heart.</p>

<p>"O Charlie, what is it?" she cried, dropping
her cloak upon the floor and throwing
off her bonnet, then putting her arms
about his neck and gazing with frightened,
questioning eyes into his that were full of
anguish.</p>

<p>"My darling, I don't know how to tell
you," he said hoarsely, holding her close.</p>

<p>"My brothers?" she gasped, turning pale
as death.</p>

<p>He bowed a silent assent.</p>

<p>"What&mdash;what is it?" she asked, scarcely
able to articulate.</p>

<p>"The very worst," he said. "Yet stay;
it may not be true; but there is a dreadful
report about town, that the train was attacked
by Indians and several killed&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rupert and Don among them?" she
faltered, half-inquiringly, as he paused, leaving
his sentence unfinished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; but, Milly dear, it may be altogether
untrue."</p>

<p>She was clinging to him and weeping as if
her very heart would break, her whole frame
shaking with sobs.</p>

<p>"My brothers, my brothers! my dear,
dear brothers!" she cried. "O Charlie,
Charlie, why did they ever go into such fearful
danger?"</p>

<p>"I thought it for the best, love, when I
advised it," he said in a pained tone; "but if
I could have foreseen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dear husband, I forgot it was by your
advice," she sobbed; "forgive me; I should
never think of blaming you."</p>

<p>"Thank you, love, I can hardly help
blaming myself, though reason tells me I am
innocent. Ah, if I could but have foreseen&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you could not; no mortal could.
Both killed? Both gone? Oh, it is too, too
terrible!"</p>

<p>The door flew open and Zillah rushed in,
closely followed by Wallace.</p>

<p>He was deathly pale, and his eyes were full
of tears. She was weeping aloud.</p>

<p>"O Milly, Milly!" she cried, "was
there ever anything so terrible? It will kill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
mother; she can never stand it in her weak
state."</p>

<p>"We must manage to keep it from her,"
the doctor said.</p>

<p>"How can we? She will see it in our
faces," sobbed Zillah.</p>

<p>"We must control our features; we must
banish every expression of grief from them
and from our words and voices when in her
presence. Her life may depend upon it, for
she is very feeble just now."</p>

<p>"We will all try," Wallace said, with a
heavy sigh. "Let none of us venture into
her presence until we are sure of ourselves."</p>

<p>"It will be very difficult, but I believe
God will give us strength," said Mildred, "if
we ask it in faith. Oh, it is an awful, awful
thing!" she cried, a fierce paroxysm of grief
sweeping over her; then, as she grew calmer,
"but we have strong consolation in the certain
knowledge that they were of those who
trust in the imputed righteousness of Christ;
that they had made their peace with God and
were ready for the summons home."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Wallace, "we sorrow not as
those without hope; and dear mother, who
lives so near the Master, and realizes so fully
the blessedness of those who have gone to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
forever with Him, will, I doubt not, be able
to bear up under this new trial, terrible as it
is, when she has regained her usual health."</p>

<p>"No doubt of it," the doctor said.</p>

<p>"But oh, it is so terrible, so terrible!"
sobbed Zillah; "far worse than any of the
many trials that have come to us in the last
two or three years."</p>

<p>"Does father know?" asked Mildred.
"Has he heard?"</p>

<p>Neither the doctor nor Wallace could answer
the question; they had not seen him
since early in the day.</p>

<p>But while they were saying so the door-bell
rang and he came in, bent, bowed down,
aged with grief, till he looked an older man
by ten&mdash;twenty years than when they had seen
him last.</p>

<p>With a moan of unspeakable anguish he
dropped into a chair and bowed his head upon
his hands.</p>

<p>His daughters flew to him and enfolded
him in loving arms, tears of sympathy streaming
down their cheeks.</p>

<p>"Father, dear, dear father," they said,
"oh, do not be so distressed! it may not be
true."</p>

<p>"Alas, alas! I dare not hope it," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
groaned. "My boys&mdash;my boys; would God
I had died for you! My sons, oh, my sons!
Such a fate! such a terrible fate!"</p>

<p>"But, dear father, think how happy they
are now," said Mildred, weeping as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes, there is great and undeserved
mercy mingled with the terrible affliction,"
he replied; "'they cannot return to me, but
I shall go to them.' Thanks be unto God for
that blessed hope! But my wife&mdash;your
mother! this will kill her!"</p>

<p>"Dear father," said Mildred, "do not
forget the precious promise, 'As thy days, so
shall thy strength be.'"</p>

<p>"We have all agreed to try to hide it
from her till she is stronger," the doctor remarked.
"We will have to school ourselves
to look and act and speak as if no such news
had reached our ears."</p>

<p>"An impossible task, I fear," sighed Mr.
Keith. "Marcia and I have had no secrets
from each other since we were married, and
it will be no easy task for me to conceal my
anguish of heart from her now; but, God
helping me, I will."</p>

<p>To father and daughters the next few days
were a severe ordeal, for it was difficult indeed
to hide their bitter grief from the love-sharpened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
eyes of the tender wife and mother;
they were cheerful when they could force
themselves to be so; and when tears would
have their way they talked of Fan, and seemed
to be mourning afresh over her early death,
or spoke of Ada in her far distant home, and
how faint was the hope that she would ever
be with them again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith seemed somewhat surprised at
these renewed manifestations of grief that had
appeared to be softened by the lapse of time;
but asking no questions, she simply talked to
them of Fan's blessedness and the good work
Ada was doing for the Master, and of the
time when they would again be a united family
in the glorious land where partings are unknown.</p>

<p>She was regaining strength every day, and
in seeing that they felt well rewarded for their
efforts at self-control and encouraged to persevere
with them; and they did, though at
times&mdash;especially when she would speak of
Rupert and Don, talking hopefully of soon
hearing of their safe arrival in California&mdash;it
was almost beyond their power; and they
were compelled to find some pretext for leaving
the room, that for a short space they might
let grief have its way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>Mildred was sitting with her mother one
morning, her babe asleep by her side in the
cradle that been occupied successively by herself
and all her brothers and sisters, Percy
quietly busied with a picture-book.</p>

<p>The two ladies had their sewing, and
Annis was conning her lessons on the farther
side of the room.</p>

<p>The door-bell rang, and Celestia Ann
ushered in a woman, a resident of the town
with whom the ladies had never had any acquaintance,
though they knew her by name.
Her call was therefore a surprise; but they
gave her a pleasant good-morning and a polite
invitation to be seated.</p>

<p>She sat down, made a few remarks about
the weather and the state of the roads, then,
looking Mrs. Keith full in the face, said, "I
s'pose you've heard the news about the last
party that set off from here for Californy?"</p>

<p>Mildred made a warning gesture, but it
was too late, and doubtless would not have
been heeded even could it have been given in
time.</p>

<p>"What news?" Mrs. Keith asked, in a
startled tone, while Annis rose and came forward
in an excited manner, her eyes wild with
affright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"So you haven't heard?" pursued the
caller, with the satisfaction of the newsmonger
in a fresh customer for her wares. "Well&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mrs. Slate," interrupted Mildred, "I
must beg you will say no more; we have
heard a vague report, which may be entirely
untrue, but have been trying to keep it from
mother, for she is too weak to bear it."</p>

<p>"What is it, Mildred, my child, what is
it?" gasped the poor invalid, turning deathly
pale.</p>

<p>"Dear mother, don't ask; it would only
distress you, and may be all a lie," Mildred
said, going to her and putting her arms about
her in tender, loving fashion.</p>

<p>"Tell me, my child, tell me; it is useless
to try to keep me in ignorance now; suspense
would be worse than the direst certainty,"
faltered the mother.</p>

<p>"But there is no certainty, mother dear,"
Mildred said pityingly, her tears falling fast
as she spoke; "oh, be content not to hear
what can but give you pain!"</p>

<p>"She'd <em>ought</em> to know," said Mrs. Slate;
"she's got to hear it sooner or later, and
what's the use of puttin' her off so? I'll tell
you, Mrs. Keith. They say the train was attacked
by the Injins and most o' the men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
killed, your two boys among the rest. I felt
it my duty to come and tell you about it, in
case you hadn't heard, and to call your attention
to the fact that this appears to be the way
Providence has taken for to punish you for
bringin' 'em up to care so much for gold;
and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Leave the house this instant, and never
venture to darken its doors again!" cried
Mildred, supporting her fainting mother with
one arm, while she turned, full of righteous
indignation, toward her tormentor with a
stamp of her foot to enforce the order she
could not refrain from giving.</p>

<p>"I've only done my dooty," muttered
the woman, rising and sailing from the room
with her head in the air.</p>

<p>"O mother, mother!" sobbed Mildred.
"Annis, help me to lay her on the lounge,
and run for Charlie. I think he's at home in
the office. The cruel, cruel creature! how
could she! oh, <em>how could</em> she!"</p>

<p>Annis, wildly weeping, hastened to obey.
"O Milly, Milly, is mother dying? Is it true
about the boys?"</p>

<p>"She has only fainted, and it is only a
report about the boys, that may not be at all
true," Mildred said. "Now call Celestia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Ann to help me, and you run for Charlie as
fast as you can. O Zillah," in a tone of relief
as the door opened and Mrs. Ormsby came in,
"I'm glad you've come. Run to mother's
room and get the bottle of ammonia."</p>

<p>Greatly startled and alarmed by the
glimpse she had got of her mother's white,
unconscious face, Zillah ran to do her sister's
bidding, while Celestia Ann, summoned by
Annis, hastened to render all the assistance in
her power, and poor, terrified Annis flew like
the wind in search of the doctor.</p>

<p>She found him in, and, though scarcely
able to articulate, made him understand that
his presence was wanted with all speed.</p>

<p>She darted back, and he caught up his
medicine-case and followed close at her heels.</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith still lay white and insensible,
the three women busy about her with half-despairing
efforts to restore her to consciousness.</p>

<p>They began to fear it was something more
than an ordinary faint. Had that sudden,
cruel announcement taken her life? Happy
for her were it so; but oh, how could husband
and children spare her?</p>

<p>Mildred turned upon her husband a look
of agonized inquiry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do not be alarmed, love," he said, "she
will revive presently, I trust."</p>

<p>Some moments of trying suspense ensued;
then her eyes opened wide and glanced about
from one to another.</p>

<p>"What has happened?" she asked, in feeble
accents; "have I been worse?"</p>

<p>"In a faint, mother; but you have come
out of it now, and I hope will be none the
worse after a little," the doctor answered
cheerfully. But ere the words had left his
lips memory had resumed her sway.</p>

<p>"Oh, my sons!" she cried, "my Rupert
and Don! Can it be true that I shall see
them no more upon earth? Have they been
cut off in the pride and beauty of their early
manhood by a savage foe? O Lord, lead me
to the Rock that is higher than I, for my
heart is overwhelmed!" she cried, clasping
her hands and lifting her streaming eyes to
heaven.</p>

<p>"Dear mother," sobbed Mildred, leaning
over her in tenderest solicitude, "if they are
gone from earth, it is to the better land, where
pain and sin and sorrow are unknown, and
where you will one day join them and all
your loved ones. But it may not be true;
there is no certainty yet; it is but a rumor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then how cruel to tell me," she sighed;
"and to add that I was to blame for their
going. Ah, God knows I have tried to train
them for heaven, and not to set their affections
upon the perishing things of time and sense."</p>

<p>"Yes, mother, your children can all testify
to that," Mildred said; Zillah adding,
"Indeed we can; if any of us are worldly-minded
it is not the fault of either of our
parents. And it was not the love of gold
that sent our dear brothers on that journey;
one was seeking health, the other went to
take care of him and with a longing for
change and exciting adventure."</p>

<p>At that moment Mr. Keith came in with
a letter in his hand. His face was brighter
and happier than they had seen it for many
days, eagerness and anxiety mingling with its
gladness.</p>

<p>"From Don to you, my dear," he cried,
holding the letter high, with its address toward
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, then it is not true! not true!" was
the simultaneous, joyful exclamation from his
daughters; and Mildred, embracing the weeping
invalid, said, "Do you hear, dearest
mother? A letter from Don, and you may
dry your tears."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Her husband held it out to her with a glad
and loving smile.</p>

<p>She grasped it eagerly, but in vain her
trembling fingers essayed to tear it open.</p>

<p>"Let me, dear wife," he said, taking it
gently from her.</p>

<p>"Read it," she said feebly; "my eyes
are dim. Oh, my Rupert! is he living
also?"</p>

<p>Mr. Keith glanced down the page, let the
letter fall, and dropped his face into his hands
with a heart-rending groan.</p>

<p>Zillah snatched it from the floor, her hand
trembling like an aspen leaf, her face overspread
with a deathly pallor.</p>

<p>"My son, my son, my first-born son!"
sobbed Mrs. Keith, "gone, gone in that
dreadful way! Yet, thank God that dear
Don is left. And blessed be His holy name
that <em>He</em> lives and reigns, and none can stay
His hand or say unto Him, What doest
thou?"</p>

<p>"Read, some one," groaned the father;
"I cannot!"</p>

<p>Zillah silently handed the letter to the doctor,
and he read it in low, moved tones, often
interrupted by the bitter weeping of his listeners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>Rupert's death was a heavy blow; for a
time his parents seemed wellnigh crushed by
it, yet not a murmur was ever heard from
either; the language of their lips and lives
was, "'Though He slay me, yet will I trust
in Him.'"</p>

<p>The manner of their son's death made it
the hardest blow they had ever received; yet
as the months rolled on they learned to speak
calmly and tenderly of him as having gone
before to the heavenly home whither they
themselves would soon follow.</p>

<p>Don's letter received a reply in due season.
It said his speedy return would be joyfully
welcomed, yet as he was now on the
ground, he was free to stay for a time if such
were his choice; so he remained, fascinated
by the hope of success in his search for gold,
and feeling a great repugnance to going back
and facing his townsmen without having secured
at least a moderate portion of that
which he had come so far to find.</p>

<p>Months and years glided swiftly by, bringing
to the Keiths only such changes as they
will bring to all: added gray hairs and wrinkles,
and a decrease of strength, vigor, and
energy to the old people; to the younger
married ones, an added staidness and dignity
of demeanor and more olive-branches about
their tables; while Annis had grown from
the merry, romping child into a tall, slender
maiden, even more comely than the child had
been, but with a quieter step and often a
dreamy, far-away look in the sweet blue eyes.</p>

<p>She was the joy of her parents' hearts,
the very light of their eyes, the only child
left at home; for Cyril, having completed his
college course, had entered a theological seminary
and was preparing to go into the ministry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>There had been all along a constant interchange
of letters with their relatives at the
Oaks, particularly brisk on the part of Annis
and Elsie, and they each knew almost as
much of the thoughts, feelings, and experiences
of the other as though they had lived
together all these years.</p>

<p>Letters from the Oaks were always joyfully
welcomed, yet were esteemed as nothing
in comparison with those that came occasionally
from Ada and Don, the former of whom
had become the happy mother of two children,
whom she described as very sweet and
lovable, adding that she had a great longing
to show them to her father and mother. And
it was perhaps not greater than the desire of
the grandparents to see them, though that
was far outweighed by their thirst for a sight
of the mother's face.</p>

<p>Mildred was still the devoted daughter she
had been in earlier days, nor less faithful in
all that concerned the welfare of husband and
children. She looked well to the ways of her
household, nor ever ate the bread of idleness.
She was a careful housekeeper, allowing no
waste, yet most liberal in paying for every service
done for her or hers, and never stinting
in the provision for the wants of her family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>Her table was always bountifully provided,
her house neat and clean, her children
well and tastefully dressed, her husband's
wardrobe carefully looked to; nor did she
neglect the souls, minds, or bodies of her children.
Their physical well-being was to her a
matter of very great importance, and while
assiduously cultivating their minds and hearts,
letting them never want for mother-love and
tender caresses, she watched over the health
of each with untiring vigilance.</p>

<p>And she had her reward in their rosy
cheeks, bounding steps, constant flow of animal
spirits, and devoted love to their parents,
especially their mother; also in their kindness
and affection toward each other.</p>

<p>They were a very happy family, a joy of
heart to Mr. and Mrs. Keith, as were Zillah's
children also, she having greatly improved in
her management as a mother since the babyhood
of her first child.</p>

<p>It was spring-time again, the evenings still
cool enough for a little fire to be very enjoyable.
In Dr. Landreth's cosey sitting-room a
bright wood fire blazed cheerily on the open
hearth. The doctor himself sat over it alone
and in meditative mood.</p>

<p>Mildred had left the room a moment before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
to see her children to bed, a duty she
never neglected, and not only a duty, but a
pleasure also, for it gave opportunity for many
a sweet interchange of demonstrations of affection
and many a childish confidence to mother
which otherwise might have been withheld;
also&mdash;the young hearts being warm, the feelings
tender&mdash;she found it the best of all seasons
for sowing good seed that might one day
spring up and grow and bear fruit unto everlasting
life.</p>

<p>The doctor's meditations seemed not unpleasant,
if one might judge from the calm
and placid expression of his countenance; yet
occasionally there was a passing shade of
doubt or anxiety.</p>

<p>He looked up with a smile as Mildred re-entered
the room. "Come and sit by my
side, dear wife," he said, "and let us have a
little confidential chat. Do you know what I
have been thinking, sitting here alone?" he
asked, as she took the offered seat and his arm
stole round her waist in very lover-like fashion.</p>

<p>"No, my dear; how should I?" she answered,
with a smile. "Of your patients, I
presume; some case of obscure and difficult
diagnosis."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, you are wide of the mark," he
returned, with a light laugh. "No; my
thoughts were principally of the presiding
genius of my happiest of homes, and I am
ready to echo the words of the wise man, 'A
prudent wife is from the Lord.' 'Whoso
findeth a wife, findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
favor of the Lord.'"</p>

<p>"You're satisfied with yours?" she said
inquiringly, and with a glad look up into his
face.</p>

<p>"More than satisfied! Milly, love, you
are my greatest earthly treasure; dearer far
to me now than the day we were married,
though then I was sure I loved you as never
man loved woman before."</p>

<p>"How you gladden my heart, my dearest
and kindest of husbands," she said, in low,
moved tones. "And my experience is the
same as yours; I loved you dearly when we
were married, but I love you ten times as
dearly now. How sweet it is to live together
as we do, with hearts so closely united, and
ever sharing each other's joys and sorrows!
Burdens thus divided are so much easier
to bear, while joys are doubled in the sharing."</p>

<p>"Yes, it is so," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">"'Then come the wild weather&mdash;come sleet or come snow,<br /></div>
<div class="verse">We will stand by each other, however it blow;<br /></div>

</div></div>

<p>They talked of their children, now three
in number; of their various dispositions, and
the best mode of managing and training
each.</p>

<p>After that, breaking a pause in the conversation,
the doctor said, "By the way, Milly,
I received a letter to-day from a second cousin
of mine, telling me that a daughter of hers, a
young lady, is in poor health, needing change
of climate and scene, her physician says, and
asking if I am willing to take her under my
care for a time, probably until next fall. My
love, would you like to take her into the
family?"</p>

<p>"I am quite willing if it is your wish, my
dear," Mildred answered, but with a slight
sigh; they were so happy and peaceful by
themselves, and this stranger might prove an
element of discord.</p>

<p>"It is not my wish if at all unpleasant to
you, wife," he said, with affectionate look
and tone. "I fear it may add to your cares
and labors; yet Flora Weston may prove one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
of those bright, merry, winsome young things
that are like a fresh breeze in a house."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so; and we are told to use hospitality
one to another without grudging,"
Mildred added, with a pleasant look and
smile. "Write her at once, Charlie, if you
feel inclined. I am glad of an opportunity
to show some attention to a relative of
yours."</p>

<p>"Just like you, Milly," he responded,
with a gratified look.</p>

<p>The letter was sent the next day, and a
few weeks later Miss Weston arrived.</p>

<p>She seemed a rather commonplace girl,
quiet and undemonstrative. Mildred found it
a task to entertain her, even with the assistance
her mother and sisters could give, and
they did all that lay in their power. She did
not sew, she cared very little for reading, she
had strength for only very short walks; she
was no talker, and seldom seemed to care to
listen.</p>

<p>Annis soon voted her an intolerable bore,
yet, to relieve Milly, spent several hours of
every day in her society. The doctor did his
share by taking her with him whenever he
drove into the country. He made many attempts
to draw her out, both then and when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
he had an evening at home, but, not succeeding,
finally came to the conclusion that there
was nothing in her.</p>

<p>He would have wholly regretted having
invited her but that her health presently began
to improve under his treatment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Flora was silently observing all
that went on in the family, especially studying
Mildred; and at length her manner&mdash;which
had at first been very cold and distant&mdash;gradually
changed till there was at times a
warmth of affection in it.</p>

<p>"You are so kind to me, Cousin Mildred,"
she said one day; "you have never neglected
anything that could add to my comfort, and
have always shown so much sympathy for my
invalidism; far more than ever my own
mother did," she added, in a bitter tone.
"Mother is very good and pious, but she has
never taken any care of her children's health;
she is duly anxious about our souls, but neglects
our bodies. I must acknowledge that I
came here strongly prejudiced against you,
simply because I had heard you were very
pious, and the way I have been brought up
had made me hate piety, hate the Bible and
prayer."</p>

<p>"O Flora! and you the child of a Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
mother!" cried Mildred, in a shocked
tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe mother is a real Christian,
and I don't wonder you are shocked at
what I have said. But if she had brought
me up as you do your children, I am sure I
should have felt quite differently. Is it any
wonder I hate the Bible when, instead of being
entertained when good with beautiful stories
out of it, I was always punished when particularly
naughty by being forced to read a certain
number of chapters in proportion to the
extent of my delinquency, and commit so
many verses to memory; besides being prayed
over&mdash;a long tedious prayer, half of which I
did not understand?"</p>

<p>"I have always tried to make the Bible a
delight to my children," said Mildred, "and
I think it is. O Flora, I feel very sorry for
you that you do not appreciate its beauty and
sweetness! Are you not old enough now to
put away your unfortunate prejudice and
learn to love it as God's own word given to
teach us how to obtain eternal life&mdash;telling
the old, old story, the sweet, sweet story of
Jesus and His love?"</p>

<p>"I have begun to like it better since I
came here," Flora answered, with an abashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
look. "I have really enjoyed the Bible stories
I have overheard you telling the children;
and somehow religion seems a lovelier
thing as I see it exhibited in your life and the
lives of Cousin Charlie and your parents and
sisters, than as my mother practises it."</p>

<p>"It grieves me to hear a daughter speak
so of her mother," Mildred said gently.</p>

<p>"I don't mean to be unkind or disrespectful
toward her," replied Flora, "but I wish
to make you understand how I came to feel
such a prejudice against piety, and against
you because I had been told you were very
pious.</p>

<p>"I am quite sure mother is good and sincere,
and not at all puffed up and self-righteous;
but I think she makes great mistakes
which prejudice people against her religion.</p>

<p>"Now, my father is not a pious man, and
some things mother does, and her refusal to
do some other things, have so turned him
against religion that he never goes inside of a
church-door.</p>

<p>"For one thing, mother won't dress like
other ladies. He wants to see her well
dressed, but she makes it a part of her religion
to go looking old-fashioned and really
dowdy. Father buys her handsome things,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
and she won't wear them; she gives them
away or cuts them up for the children, and I
don't wonder he won't go to church with her.
I am pretty sure he might have become a regular
attendant if she would only have dressed
to suit him.</p>

<p>"And sometimes she gets out of her
warm bed, in a cold winter night, and goes
off into a room where there is no fire, and
stays there for an hour or more&mdash;in her bare
feet and her night-dress&mdash;praying. Then she
comes back chilled through; probably has a
dreadful cold the next day, and that makes
father mad, and he lays it all to her religion.</p>

<p>"I love my mother, Cousin Mildred, but
I can't help blaming her for at least a part of
my sufferings. As I have told you, she has
never taken any care of her children's health;
if our food was improperly cooked, it was a
matter of no importance; and just so if our
clothing, beds, or bedding were left unaired,
or if any other sanitary measure were disregarded.
We were often forced to eat and
sleep in a close, almost stifling atmosphere;
we wore our winter clothes into the heat of
summer, and our thin summer clothing far on
into the damp, cold days of autumn and early
winter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then, too, when I began to complain of
this dreadful pain in my back, no notice was
taken, and I was expected to do as much as if
I were perfectly well and strong; she would
not hire as much help as she might, as father
was quite willing she should, and I was often
left to do everything while she spent hours at
a time in her closet.</p>

<p>"I've thought sometimes that life would
have been easier for me if I'd had a worldly-minded
mother who would have taken some
care of my health. And I expected to find
you the same kind of Christian, but you are
very different."</p>

<p>"I fear the difference is not all in my
favor," Mildred said.</p>

<p>"But don't you think health ought to be
taken care of?" asked Flora. "I have noticed
that you are very careful of your children's,
as well as of their morals and manners."</p>

<p>"Yes," Mildred said, "I think the Bible
teaches very plainly that we are to be careful
of our bodies. 'What? know ye not that
your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost
which is in you, which ye have of God, and
ye are not your own?' Health is one of
God's good gifts and not to be despised; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
one of the greatest of temporal blessings; besides,
to be careless of it is to lessen our ability
to work for God, and probably to shorten our
lives; which we certainly have no right to do.</p>

<p>"But, Flora, perhaps I am not so different
from your mother as you think; I, too, love
to spend an hour alone in communion with
my best Friend; and I do not find it time
lost, for thus I gather strength for the duties,
trials, and temptations of life. I never could
meet them without the strength and wisdom
that He gives in answer to prayer."</p>

<p>"But you don't seem to neglect other
duties for that," Flora said, with an earnest,
inquiring look at Mildred.</p>

<p>"I hope not," was the answer; "the
Bible tells us there is a time for everything,
and it bids us 'be diligent in business;' but
also 'fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.' It
tells us, 'In everything give thanks,' and also
bids us 'pray without ceasing;' so that it is
evident that we need not always retire into
the closet to talk with our heavenly Father,
but that while our hands are busy with the
work He has given us to do, we may, and
should be, ever and anon lifting up our hearts
in silent prayer to Him.</p>

<p>"O Flora, what a blessed privilege it is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
be permitted to do that at all times and in all
places! when in doubt to ask Him for wisdom
and guidance, though it be in regard to but a
seemingly trivial matter (for great events
often hang upon trifles), when tempted to
indolence, petulance, censoriousness, or any
other sin, to be able on the instant to send up
a cry for strength to resist; a cry to Him
who is the hearer and answerer of prayer, and
who has all power in heaven and in earth.
Or if danger threatens one's self or one's dear
ones, what a relief to be able to call at once
for help to One who is mighty to save!"</p>

<p>Flora was in a, for her, surprisingly talkative
mood. "Cousin Mildred," she said, "I
have been admiring the good behavior of your
children ever since I came here. They are so
obedient, so gentle-mannered, and so polite to
you and their father, to each other, and indeed
to everybody. How have you managed to
make them so?"</p>

<p>"There is no great secret about it," Mildred
said, smiling. "We try to teach them
politeness and consideration for others by both
precept and example; my husband is always
quite as polite and attentive to me as he could
be to any strange lady guest. I try to be the
same to him, and we both treat our children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
in the same manner; we never give a command
when a request will answer as well, and
we seldom meet with any hesitation in obedience;
but if we do, I assure you we resort to
command, and enforce it, too."</p>

<p>"Do you teach them they must obey because
you are their parents?" asked Flora,
with a look of keen curiosity.</p>

<p>"Certainly we do," Mildred answered, in
some surprise.</p>

<p>"I once read a description of a very nice
kind of mother," explained Flora&mdash;"at least
the author evidently meant her for a model&mdash;and
one thing he said in her praise was that
she never claimed a right to her child's obedience
on the plea that she was his mother."</p>

<p>"Then," said Mildred gravely, "he was
either unacquainted with the teachings of
God's Word, or had no respect for them, for
there are very many passages that teach children
the duty of obedience to parents, and
others that command parents to see to it that
their children are obedient to them.</p>

<p>"There is the fifth commandment, 'Honor
thy father and thy mother: that thy days may
be long upon the land which the Lord thy
God giveth thee.' Again, 'Children, obey
your parents in the Lord: for this is right.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
'Honor thy father and mother; which is the
first commandment with promise.' 'My son,
keep thy father's commandment, and forsake
not the law of thy mother,' and many others.</p>

<p>"Then to parents, 'Correct thy son, and
he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight
unto thy soul,' and many others of like
import; while Solomon tells us, 'A child left
to himself bringeth his mother to shame.'</p>

<p>"And how sorely Eli was punished for not
restraining his sons when they made themselves
vile. Also God says, in commendation
of Abraham, 'I know him, that he will command
his children and his household after
him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord
to do justice and judgment.' And do you
not remember that under the Levitical law the
punishment of a refusal to be obedient to
parents was death?"</p>

<p>"Is that so? I had quite forgotten it,"
said Flora.</p>

<p>Mildred opened a Bible, and turning to
the twenty-first chapter of Deuteronomy, read
aloud, "'If a man have a stubborn and rebellious
son, which will not obey the voice of
his father, or the voice of his mother, and
that, when they have chastened him, will not
hearken unto them: then shall his father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
his mother lay hold on him, and bring him
out unto the elders of his city, and unto the
gate of his place; and they shall say unto the
elders of his city, This our son is stubborn
and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he
is a glutton, and a drunkard. And all the
men of his city shall stone him with stones,
that he die; so shalt thou put evil away from
among you; and all Israel shall hear and
fear.'"</p>

<p>"I acknowledge that you have proved
your case against my author," said Flora
thoughtfully; "either he was ignorant of the
teachings of Scripture on that point, or he
chose to disregard them; which nobody has a
right to do."</p>

<p>"No, that is true," said Mildred; "as
the Word of God, whose creatures we are, it
should be to all of us the rule of faith and
practice; a tribunal from which there is no
appeal; whose decisions are final."</p>

<p>"I have noticed," remarked Flora, "that
you all seem to regard it in that light, and to
have a great love for it too."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mildred; "and no wonder;
its precious promises have been our comfort
and support in many trials&mdash;some of them
very heavy. I think those sweet promises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
were all that kept my mother's heart from
breaking when she heard that her two sons
had been killed by the Indians."</p>

<p>"It must have been dreadful," Flora
said, with sympathy; "but it wasn't true?"</p>

<p>"Not of both, but of one," Mildred answered,
with emotion. "Oh, my dear, dear
brother!" she cried, in a sudden burst of
grief.</p>

<p>Flora went to her and put her arms about
her. "Don't weep so," she said; "think
how happy he is where he has gone, and how
safe; no one can ever make him suffer again."</p>

<p>"I know; and what a comfort it is!" said
Mildred; "what joy in the thought that we
shall all meet at last in that blessed land,
never to part again, and to be forever with
the Lord!"</p>

<p>From that day Flora seemed a changed
girl, ready to talk and to take an interest in
those about her, to appreciate and respond to
their efforts to entertain her, and particularly
demonstrative and affectionate toward Mildred.</p></div>

<p>On a pleasant October day the three families&mdash;including
Miss Weston&mdash;were gathered
at Mr. Keith's for a family tea-party; no very
unusual occurrence.</p>

<p>The railroad had recently reached Pleasant
Plains, and a few minutes before the call to
tea the whistle of the afternoon train from the
West had been heard.</p>

<p>They had but just seated themselves about
the table, and Mr. Keith had asked a blessing
on the food, when the door opened, and a
stranger entered unannounced.</p>

<p>Every one looked up in surprise as he
stood silently gazing at the mother.</p>

<p>The next instant she sprang up with a
joyful cry and threw herself into his outstretched
arms, weeping hysterically.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don!" was the simultaneous exclamation
from the others, and they gathered about
him laughing and crying in joyous excitement.</p>

<p>Yes, it was Don, and no other&mdash;Don who
went away a smooth-faced boy, and had come
back a bearded man.</p>

<p>With what a rapture of delight they
embraced and welcomed him; yet delight
mingled with grief, for how could they forget
that two had gone out from them, and but
one had returned? Celestia Ann stood outside
of the circle, leaning her back against the
wall and gazing at Don, the big tears streaming
down her homely but kindly face; at
length, stepping forward, she caught his hand
in a vise-like grasp, saying, "It's Mister
Don, sure enough, though I wouldn't a
knowed him by his looks. They've all been
a-huggin' and kissin' of you, and now it's my
turn," catching him round the neck and giving
him a resounding kiss. "You'll not mind,
will you? seein' as I've know'd ye ever since
you was a little feller&mdash;a mere baby, as one
may say."</p>

<p>"I am very glad to find you here still,
Celestia Ann," Don said, with a good-humored
laugh; "and I don't object to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
heartiness of your welcome; for I haven't had
a kiss from a woman since I left home, until
to-day."</p>

<p>"Well, no; I reckon not; I shouldn't
never b'lieve you was the kind of a feller to
be a-kissin' strange women folks. But now
why on airth don't ye all set down and eat?
Mr. Don must be awful hungry a-comin' all
the way from Californy here."</p>

<p>"Most assuredly, if he has had nothing to
eat since he started," laughed the doctor, resuming
his place at the table, all the others
doing likewise.</p>

<p>Then they remembered to introduce the
returned wanderer to Flora, who had been a
silent but not unmoved spectator of the little
scene.</p>

<p>Far more talking than eating ensued.</p>

<p>Don did greater justice to the viands than
most of the others, who were much occupied
in looking at and listening to him; his mother
especially. She feasted her eyes on his face,
and lost not a tone of the voice she had for
years feared she might never hear again this
side the grave.</p>

<p>And he was perforce the chief speaker,
though he had many questions to ask of relatives,
friends, and acquaintance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>Parents, sisters, and brothers-in-law wanted
to know all he had seen, done, and suffered,
and plied him with questions till his mother
remarked they were making him talk too
much and giving him no chance to eat.</p>

<p>"And it is the very best meal I have sat
down to since I went away nearly four years
ago; I ought to be allowed to do it justice,"
laughed Don.</p>

<p>They were a long while at the table; yet
Celestia Ann showed no impatience, though
usually in great haste to "get the table cleared
and the dishes washed up."</p>

<p>But at last they all withdrew to the
parlor.</p>

<p>It was verging upon ten o'clock, yet no
one seemed to have thought of bed, though
Don might well have been supposed to be
tired with his long and wearisome journey.
Mildred and Zillah had taken their babies
home, seen them safely to bed, and, leaving
them in the care of their nurses, returned to
the circle gathered in the parlor of their
father's house.</p>

<p>Don was telling some of his adventures,
and no one but Celestia Ann in the kitchen
noticed the ringing of the door-bell.</p>

<p>She, hastening to answer it, found a tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
man, wearing a very heavy beard and mustache,
standing there.</p>

<p>"Good-evening," he said, with a polite
inclination of the head; "is my&mdash;is Mrs.
Keith in?"</p>

<p>Celestia Ann staggered back, turning very
pale in the light of the lamp that hung suspended
from the ceiling. "I&mdash;I should say
I knowed that voice if&mdash;if the feller that
owned it hadn't been killed dead by the Injuns
more'n three years back; leastways so we
hearn tell," she gasped. "Be ye Rupert
Keith, or his ghost?"</p>

<p>"I am no ghost, Celestia Ann," he said
with a smile. "Reports are sometimes quite
untrue, as was the one you speak of."</p>

<p>She grasped his hand, and burst out sobbing
for very joy.</p>

<p>"There, there!" he said kindly, "I am
afraid mother will hear and be alarmed. If
she should hurry out and find me here&mdash;so
unexpectedly, it might be more than she could
well bear."</p>

<p>"Yes, she'd ought to be prepared; 'specially
as she's had one great surprise a'ready
to day in Don's comin'&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What, is Don here? just returned?" he
cried. "Oh, but that is good news! They're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
in the parlor, I think; I'll go into the sitting-room
and get you to call Dr. Landreth out
(the rest will suppose he's wanted to see a
patient), and he can prepare my mother."</p>

<p>"A first-rate plan, Mr. Rupert," said
Celestia Ann. Waiting till he reached the
door of the sitting-room, she opened that of
the parlor.</p>

<p>"Doctor," she said, "there's a man out
here a-wantin' to speak to ye."</p>

<p>"Oh, I hope it isn't a call to the country,"
remarked Mildred, as her husband made haste
to obey the summons.</p>

<p>The conversation in the parlor went on,
no one supposing the caller a person in whom
any of them had an interest.</p>

<p>As the doctor entered the sitting-room the
stranger rose and held out his hand. "Very
glad to see you again, Dr. Landreth. You
have not forgotten me?" he said inquiringly,
and with a humorous look.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I have, sir; if ever I had
the pleasure of your acquaintance," was the
reply, as the offered hand was taken, and the
doctor gazed doubtfully into the bronzed and
bearded face.</p>

<p>"Ah, Charlie, is your memory so short?"
Rupert asked in a half-reproachful tone, holding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
fast his brother-in-law's hand and looking
him steadily in the eyes.</p>

<p>"Why!" gasped the doctor, "it isn't, it
can't be&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, it can be, and it is," laughed
Rupert, though his voice trembled with emotion;
"God has mercifully spared me and
brought me back again to my father's house.
Are all well? Can you prepare my mother
for the news that I am yet alive and here?"</p>

<p>"In a moment&mdash;when I have myself so
far recovered from the shock as to be fully
able to control my voice," answered the
doctor jocosely, but with a very perceptible
tremble in his tones. "My dear fellow, if I
am so overcome with happiness, what will she
be?"</p>

<p>"Joy seldom kills?" Rupert said interrogatively.</p>

<p>"Rarely; and yet it has been fatal in some
instances. We must move with caution."</p>

<p>He stepped into the hall, opened the parlor
door, and called softly to his wife.</p>

<p>She came to him at once. "What is it?
has baby wakened?"</p>

<p>He gently drew the door to behind her
before he answered. Then taking her in his
arms, "Milly, love," he said tenderly, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
she noticed that his voice was unsteady, "can
you bear very great joy?"</p>

<p>She gave him a startled look. "What is
it? O Rupert? No, no, that cannot be!"</p>

<p>"Yes, dearest, news has come that his&mdash;that
the report of his death was false&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Is he here?" she gasped. "O Charlie,
don't keep me in suspense! take me to
him."</p>

<p>"I did not say he was here, love; only
that he was still alive at last reports."</p>

<p>But through the half-open door of the
sitting-room she had caught a glimpse of a tall
form that wore a strangely familiar look, and
breaking from her husband's arms she ran to
see who it was; ran into the arms of her long
lost and deeply mourned brother, outstretched
to receive her.</p>

<p>He held her close, she weeping hysterically
on his breast. "Dear, dear brother!
where, where have you been so long, so very
long! while we wept and mourned for you as
dead?"</p>

<p>"A captive among the Indians," he answered.
"Tell me, has there been any break
in the dear circle since I went away?"</p>

<p>"No, we are all here."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that!" he said with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
reverent gratitude. "And now I must see
my mother; I can wait no longer."</p>

<p>"Just one moment: I will send father
out and break the good news to her as gently
and cautiously as I can," Mildred said, and
glided away through the hall and into the parlor,
her eyes full of glad tears, her face radiant
with joy.</p>

<p>"Some one in the sitting-room wishes to
see you, father," she whispered to him; then
turning to the others, as he rose and went out,
she was opening her lips to speak when Annis
exclaimed, "Why, Milly, you look as if you
had found a gold mine!"</p>

<p>"Better than that," cried Mildred, dropping
on her knees by her mother's side and
putting her arms about her. "Mother, dear,
can you bear the best of good tidings?"</p>

<p>"What is it, child? tell me at once; nothing
is so hard to bear as suspense," said Mrs.
Keith, turning pale. "Has Ada come
home? Don't keep me from her a moment,"
and she rose hastily, as if to hurry from the
room.</p>

<p>"No, mother, not that; but still better
and stranger news," Mildred said, gently
forcing her back into her seat; "a gentleman
just returned from the far West brings the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
news that our Rupert was only taken prisoner
by the Indians, not killed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Keith seemed about to faint; a sudden,
death-like pallor overspread her face, and
Don threw his arm round her.</p>

<p>"Mother, dear, it is good news; what
could be better?" he said, his voice quivering
with excitement and joy.</p>

<p>"Yes," she responded, her color coming
back; "oh, can it be possible that my son yet
lives? 'Oh that men would praise the Lord
for his goodness and for his wonderful works
to the children of men!'"</p>

<p>Then starting to her feet, "Is the gentleman
here? I must see him, speak to him, hear
all he can tell me of my dear boy."</p>

<p>"Oh, wait just a moment, mother, dear,"
Mildred said, springing up and laying a
detaining hand on her mother's arm; "father
has gone out to speak to him. Ah, here he
is," as Mr. Keith re-entered the room, his face
shining with joy, every feature quivering with
emotion.</p>

<p>He stepped hurriedly toward the little
group. "Wife! wife!" he cried, catching
her in his arms, "our boy, our dear Rupert;
we have not lost him yet; he is restored to
us as from the grave; he lives! he lives!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
thank God for his unmerited goodness and
mercy!"</p>

<p>Rupert had followed his father, and standing
at the half-open parlor door, thence catching
a glimpse of his mother's loved face, he
could restrain himself no longer.</p>

<p>In another moment he had her in his arms,
holding her close and covering her face with
kisses.</p>

<p>She did not faint, but lay on his breast
weeping for joy as if she would weep her very
life away, the rest looking on and weeping
with her.</p>

<p>At last she lifted her head for a long,
searching gaze into his face; the dear face she
had not thought ever to see again on earth.
"You are changed," she said, the tears
streaming down her cheeks; "you have
grown older, darker&mdash;there are lines of care
and suffering my heart aches to see&mdash;but it is
my own boy still; and your mother's eyes
would have recognized you anywhere."</p>

<p>"And you, dearest mother, have grown so
thin and pale, your hair so white," he said,
with emotion.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my son; I shall grow
young again now," she answered with a touch
of her old time gayety; then gently withdrawing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
herself from his arms, looked on with
eyes full of glad tears while brothers and sisters,
each in turn, embraced and rejoiced over
the lost and found again.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most affecting part of the
scene was the meeting of the two brothers, each
of whom had long believed the other slain.</p>

<p>But it was a moving spectacle throughout;
Celestia Ann, peering in at the door, cried
heartily from very sympathy, and Flora Weston,
feeling like an intruder upon the sacred
privacy of the family, stole quietly away to
Dr. Landreth's, leaving word with Celestia
Ann that she had gone "thinking it time for
an invalid to be in bed."</p>

<p>But it was long before her absence was
noticed.</p>

<p>Rupert did not attempt to tell his story
that night; it was much too long, he said; to-morrow
he would gather them all about him,
if they liked, and go into the details. In the
mean while there is something which he must
say at once.</p>

<p>"I shall greatly surprise you all, I know,"
he said, with a happy smile. "Mother, dear,"
turning to her, "do not be shocked when I
tell you that I have brought a wife with me."</p>

<p>He read a look of astonishment, not unmixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
with dismay, on every face; but they
waited in silence to hear what more he had to
say.</p>

<p>"She is a Mexican," he went on, "of
Spanish descent, and very beautiful, I think;
but, better still, she is a Protestant and a real
Christian, so far as man may judge. We
were fellow-captives, and I doubtless owe my
life to her kind and skilful nursing."</p>

<p>"Then we will all welcome her!" exclaimed
both his parents in a breath.
"Where is she now?"</p>

<p>"At the hotel; she feared to come upon
you without previous announcement; in fact,
she is very much afraid of being unwelcome
as it is," Rupert answered, with a wistful
glance from one to another of the loved faces
about him.</p>

<p>"Tell her she needn't," cried Mildred,
with impulsive warmth. "Say that we owe
her a debt of gratitude it will be impossible
ever to pay, if she is a good and loving wife
to the dear brother whose life she has saved."</p>

<p>"Yes, tell her that," said his mother.
"Go and bring her to us. She shall have a
daughter's welcome from me."</p>

<p>"May I go with you?" Don asked, as
Rupert rose to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>"And I?" added the father, rising also.
"We will assure her of her welcome before
she has to face us all here."</p>

<p>"I feel inclined to go myself," said the
mother, smiling affectionately upon Rupert;
"but no, on second thoughts I should rather
have our first interview here, with no prying
eyes to look on."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "that will be best;
but," and he glanced a little wistfully at his
sisters.</p>

<p>All three at once offered to accompany
him.</p>

<p>"Thank you, you dear girls," he said
heartily, "but some of you should stay with
mother."</p>

<p>After a little discussion it was agreed that
Zillah should go, the others to await the coming
of the new sister where they were.</p>

<p>The hotel was at no great distance, and they
had not long to wait. The little party presently
returned, and Rupert led proudly up to
his mother one of the most beautiful, graceful,
and altogether bewitching young creatures she
had ever seen.</p>

<p>"Mother, this is your new daughter;
Juanita, our mother," he said, and they
embraced with warmth of affection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"I love you now for my dear son's sake;
and all that he tells me you have done for
him, and I hope very soon to love you for
your own," Mrs. Keith said. "I, too, the
same for my Rupert's sake," the girl-wife
answered in liquid tones, and pure English,
only a slight and pretty accent betraying the
fact that it was not her native tongue. "I
hope you will be my dearest mamma, if so be
that you can love a foreigner."</p>

<p>"We will not call or consider you that,
dear child," responded Mrs. Keith with feeling,
and bestowing another kiss upon the rich
red lips; "Rupert tells me you are a Christian,
and 'we are all one in Christ Jesus;'
no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens
with the saints and of the household
of God ... Jesus Christ himself being the
chief corner-stone."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, then we will love one
another very much," said the young bride,
tears of joy shining in her beautiful dark eyes.
"Now I feel that I shall be very happy in my
husband's dear home that he has told me of
so many, many times."</p>

<p>"I hope you will," Mildred said, embracing
her affectionately in her turn; "I trust
we shall become dear sisters to each other.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
We all want you to feel at home among
us."</p>

<p>Annis came next. "I am your youngest
sister," she said, bestowing and receiving a
kiss; "at least the youngest here."</p>

<p>"I have none other," returned the bride
in slightly saddened tones. "My husband,"
and she turned a look of ineffable affection
upon Rupert, "is all I have; father, mother,
brother, sister I have none."</p>

<p>"Ah, we must indeed be kind to you, poor
lonely dear!" said Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>But it was growing late, and the travellers
were weary with the long journey.</p>

<p>Mr. Keith read a short psalm of praise,
every heart echoing the words; they sung the
doxology, "Praise God from whom all blessings
flow," a short prayer of fervent thanksgiving
followed, and they separated for the
night, Annis full of delight at the thought of
how deeply interested Elsie would be in the
story she meant to write her of the strange,
the wonderful events of this day.</p>

<p>For very joy the parents could not sleep;
they lay awake a long while talking of their
sons and the new daughter.</p>

<p>"She looks very young," Mr. Keith remarked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"About eighteen, I should think," said his
wife. "Poor lonely dear! we must be very
kind to her, especially for what she did for
Rupert."</p>

<p>"Yes, as kind as we know how to be,"
assented Mr. Keith. "I cannot yet quite
overcome a feeling of repugnance at the
thought of a foreigner as a daughter-in-law;
but I trust I shall be able to in time; and in
the mean while I certainly intend to treat her
as well as if I were delighted with the match."</p>

<p>"She is very beautiful," remarked his
wife; "what lovely, expressive eyes she
has!"</p>

<p>"Very, and they gaze at Rupert as if he
were a sort of demigod in her opinion,"
laughed the father. A happy, gleeful laugh
it was.</p>

<p>"Our boy's return is making you young
again, Stuart," said his wife.</p>

<p>"Both of us, I hope, my dear," he responded.
"But now we must try to sleep, or
I fear we shall feel old in the morning."</p>

<p>The whole family were disposed to think
well of the new member and make her quite
one of themselves, especially for Rupert's
sake. Don expressed himself as delighted
with her looks and manners, and "How beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
she is!" "Yes, perfectly lovely," were
the sentences exchanged between Mildred and
Zillah as they left their father's door that
night to go to their own homes; and Flora
received quite an enthusiastic description of
her charms from the doctor when they met at
the breakfast-table the next morning.</p>

<p>"Did you see our new sister last night,
Celestia Ann?" asked Annis, busy adorning
the breakfast-table in her home with flowers.</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon I did, Annis. Wasn't I in
to the readin', prayin', and singin'? Yes, I
see her, and I think she's about the purtiest
creeter that I ever sot eyes on. I on'y hope
she'll turn out as good as she's purty. I
wish't she wasn't a furriner, though; for
somehow I can't seem to like 'em quite so
well as our own folks."</p>

<p class="center">"Calamity is man's true touchstone."</p>


<p class="mt2">In their retreat after the attack upon the
emigrant train to which Rupert and Don belonged,
the Indians passed again over the
ground where they had shot down the latter.</p>

<p>He still lay motionless and insensible, just
as he had fallen from his horse. Several of
the savages dismounted and stooped over him,
one drawing a scalping-knife from his belt,
and with the other hand seizing Rupert by the
hair.</p>

<p>At that instant consciousness returned.
Rupert opened his eyes, and seeing the gleaming
knife lifted high in the air, sent up a
swift but silent cry to God for help.</p>

<p>The Indian's hold upon his hair suddenly
relaxed, and the knife was returned to his belt.
He had changed his mind, as he gave his
companions to understand in a few words
quite unintelligible to Rupert, who was indeed
again fast losing consciousness; an answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
sentence or two came indistinctly to his ear as
sounds from the far distance; then he knew
nothing more for a time, how long he could
not tell; but on recovering consciousness he
found himself strapped to the back of an
Indian pony which was slowly toiling up a
steep ascent; a narrow path winding round a
mountain; on the right a rocky wall, on the
other a sheer descent of many hundred feet.</p>

<p>Rupert turned dizzy, sick, and faint as he
caught a glimpse of the frightful precipice,
the foaming stream and jagged rocks at its
base; and but for the thongs that bound him
firmly to the back of his steed, he must inevitably
have fallen and been dashed to pieces
upon them.</p>

<p>He could not in that first moment remember
what had befallen him, and called in a
faint voice upon his brother, "Don, where
are we?"</p>

<p>No reply, and he called again, more faintly
than before, for he was very weak from pain
and loss of blood, "Don, Don!"</p>

<p>An Indian's "Ugh!" and a few words in
an unknown tongue answered him from the
rear.</p>

<p>The sounds were guttural and harsh, and
seemed to him to command silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Instantly he comprehended that he was a
prisoner and in whose hands; sorely wounded
too, for every movement of his pony gave
him exquisite pain; and now memory recalled
the events of the afternoon&mdash;the chase, the
stinging shot, the fall from his horse, then
the waking as from a dream, to feel the grasp
upon his hair and see the scalping-knife held
aloft in the air and just ready to descend upon
his devoted head.</p>

<p>Question upon question crowded upon his
mind. Where were his late companions,
Morton and Smith? were they killed? were
they prisoners like himself? or had they
escaped? Had the train been attacked; and
if so, what was the result? Oh, above all,
where was Don, the younger brother, over
whom he was to have watched with paternal
care? He would have defended Don's life
and liberty with his own; but, alas, the opportunity
was denied him.</p>

<p>He thought of his own probable fate:
what was there to expect but torture and
death? He remembered to have read that the
Indians sometimes carried a prisoner a long
distance that the rest of their tribe might
share the delight of witnessing his dying torments.
Rupert shuddered at the thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
this was the fate reserved for him, and feeling
very weak, half hoped he might die on the
way to meet it.</p>

<p>Silently he lifted up his heart in prayer to
God for help and succor in this his sore extremity,
and that the consolations of God
might not be small to the dear ones at home&mdash;especially
the tender mother&mdash;when the
news of his sad fate should reach them.</p>

<p>The last gleams of the setting sun lighted
up the lofty pathway they were pursuing,
but down in that deep valley at the foot of the
mountain it was already growing dark; he
could see into its depths as he lay with his
cheek resting on the neck of the pony; turning
his head, the wall of rock towering on the
other side came into view.</p>

<p>He was bound hand and foot and could lift
only his head; he seemed to have hardly
strength for that; but, anxious to learn the
number of his captors and whether he were
the only prisoner, he made an effort, feebly
lifted it, and glanced before and behind him.</p>

<p>He could only see that there were several
mounted Indians ahead, and one or more in
his rear, all hideous in war-paint and feathers;
there might be many more at each end of the
line&mdash;for they were travelling single file, along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the narrow, winding path, but a small portion
of which came within the line of his vision.
And there might be other prisoners, though
he saw none.</p>

<p>Even that slight exertion had exhausted
him; his head dropped, and again pain of body
and distress of mind were forgotten in a long
and death-like swoon.</p>

<p>It was night, lighted only by the stars, and
the path winding downward, when again he
revived for a few moments shivering and benumbed
with cold, weak and faint with hunger
and loss of blood, and suffering greatly
from the pain of his wounds.</p>

<p>He heard no sound but the rush of a
mountain torrent and the clatter of the horses'
hoofs over the stony way; he had scarcely
more than noted these things when again his
senses forsook him.</p>

<p>When next he revived, two of his captors
were busy in undoing the rope that made him
fast to the pony, which was standing stock
still on level ground only a few feet from a
fire of brushwood, that sent up flame and
smoke and blazed and crackled with a cheery
sound which spoke of warmth for benumbed
limbs, while some venison and trout broiling on
the coals gave out a savory smell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Several warriors were grouped about the
fire, one giving particular attention to the
cooking, the others lounging in picturesque
and restful attitudes on the grass.</p>

<p>Rupert was quickly lifted from the pony
and laid on the grass beside them, with his
feet to the fire. Then the cord was taken
from his wrists and a bit of the smoking venison
put into his hand. He devoured it ravenously,
and, his hunger appeased, presently fell
into a deep sleep; having first committed
himself and dear ones to the care and protection
of that God who is everywhere present
and almighty to defend and save.</p>

<p>His wounds had been rudely bound up in
a way to stanch the flow of blood, it being
the desire of his captors to keep him alive, at
least for a time. More mercifully disposed
than they oftentimes are, and knowing that
he was too weak for flight, they left him unbound
through the night, merely fastening a
cord round each arm and securing the other
end to the arm of a stout warrior, one of
whom lay on each side of the prisoner.</p>

<p>Rupert had noted as they laid him down
that no other white man was in sight; this
gave him hope that the rest had escaped; yet
he could not know that it was not by death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
so that the discovery brought small relief to
his anxiety of mind on their account.</p>

<p>Morning found him feverish and ill, his
wounds very painful; but at an early hour
the Indians resumed their line of march with
him in the midst, strapped to the pony as before.</p>

<p>It was a terrible journey, climbing steep
ascents, creeping along narrow ledges of
rock, where a single false step would have
sent them down hundreds of feet, to be dashed
in pieces upon the sharp points of the rocks
below; now descending by paths as steep, narrow,
and dangerous as those by which they
had ascended, and anon fording streams so
deep and swift that the helpless, hapless prisoner
was in imminent danger of drowning.</p>

<p>He, poor fellow, was too ill to note the
direction in which they were travelling,
though he had a vague idea that it was in the
main south-westerly.</p>

<p>Beside the difficulties and dangers of the
way, he suffered intensely from the pain of
his wounds, and often from intolerable thirst.</p>

<p>One day he woke as from a troubled sleep
to find himself lying on a bearskin in an
Indian wigwam, a young girl sitting beside
him embroidering a moccasin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Their eyes met, and hers, large, soft, and
dark as those of a gazelle, lighted up with
pleased surprise.</p>

<p>"You are better, señor," she said, in low
musical tones, and in the Spanish tongue.</p>

<p>Rupert understood her; he was fond of
languages, and had gained a good knowledge
of Spanish from Dr. Landreth, who had
learned to speak it fluently during his long
sojourn in South America.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said faintly in that tongue,
"and you have been my kind nurse?"</p>

<p>"It has been happiness to care for the
weak and wounded stranger," she said in her
liquid tones, "though I little thought he
could speak to me in my own language; for
you are not my countryman, señor; your face
is too fair."</p>

<p>"I am from the United States," he replied.
"And you, fair lady?"</p>

<p>"I am a Mexican, a captive among the
Indians like yourself," was the mournful reply,
tears gathering in the beautiful eyes.</p>

<p>His heart was touched with sympathy, and
he was opening his lips to express it; but with
playful authority she bade him be quiet and
not waste his feeble strength in talk.</p>

<p>Then she brought him food and drink prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
by her own fair hands, and fed him too&mdash;for
he had scarce strength to feed himself&mdash;and
directly his hunger was satisfied he fell
asleep again.</p>

<p>When again he woke it was night; the
stars were shining in the sky, as he could see
through the opening in the top of the wigwam
left for the escape of smoke, and by their
glimmer he could faintly perceive the outlines
of dusky forms lying on all sides of him;
their quietude and the sound of their breathing
telling that they slept.</p>

<p>The impulse came strongly upon him to
rise and flee&mdash;captivity was so dreadful,
liberty so sweet&mdash;and it might be that, though
so strangely spared up to this time, torture and
death were yet to be his portion if he remained.</p>

<p>He started up, but only to fall back again
in utter exhaustion. He could do nothing to
save himself, and there was no earthly helper
near; but sweetly to his mind came the opening
verses of the forty-sixth psalm, "God is
our refuge and strength, a very present help
in trouble. Therefore will we not fear,
though the earth be removed, and though the
mountains be carried into the midst of the
sea," and silently committing himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
loved ones&mdash;all, alas, so far distant&mdash;to the care
of that almighty Friend, he fell asleep again.</p>

<p>He was quite alone when next he woke, and
it was broad daylight, for a bright sunbeam
had found its way through the opening in the
roof, and laid bare to his view the whole interior
of the wigwam, with all its filth and lack
of the comforts of civilized life.</p>

<p>All was silence within, but from without
came the merry shouts and laughter of the
Indian children at play. Presently one pushed
aside the curtain of skins answering for a door,
and a pair of wild black eyes stared Rupert in
the face for a moment; then the curtain fell,
and soft, swift-retreating footfalls came faintly
to his ear.</p>

<p>Not many minutes had passed when it was
again drawn aside, and Juanita, the Mexican
girl he had seen the day before, stepped
within, dropping it behind her.</p>

<p>Her sweet though melancholy smile seemed
to light up the forlorn hut as she bade Rupert
good-morning in her liquid tones, using
the Spanish tongue as before, and asked if
he could eat the morsel she had brought.
Alas, not such a breakfast as would have been
served him in his own far-away home.</p>

<p>It was a broiled fish, hot from the coals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
laid upon a bit of bark covered with green
oak-leaves in lieu of a napkin. He thanked
her gratefully, and asked if she could give him
some water with which to wash his face and
hands before eating.</p>

<p>Setting his breakfast on the ground beside
him, she went out, and presently returned
with a gourd filled with cold, clear water from
a little stream that ran sparkling and dancing
down the mountain-side but a few yards away.</p>

<p>He first took a long deep draught, for he
was suffering with feverish thirst, then laved
face and hands, she handing him his own
pocket-handkerchief, which had been washed
in the stream and dried in the sun, to use in
place of a towel.</p>

<p>He recognized it; then glancing down at
his person, saw that he was attired in the
clothes he had on when taken, and that, as
they were free from blood-stains, they too
must have been washed by some kindly hand
and replaced upon him after their cleansing.</p>

<p>"How much I owe you!" he said, looking
gratefully at her.</p>

<p>"No, not much," she answered, with shy
modesty. "Now eat, señor, or your breakfast
will be cold."</p>

<p>"I must first rest a little," he returned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
with a sigh of weariness, as he fell back exhausted
upon his rude couch.</p>

<p>She caught up several deer and bear skins
that lay scattered about, rolled them together
and placed them as a pillow under his head;
then drawing two small objects from beneath
that one on which he had been lying, she held
them up to his gaze, asking, "Do you value
these, señor?"</p>

<p>"Indeed do I," he cried, stretching out an
eager hand; "my precious little Bible and
my medicine case! I am thankful beyond
expression that they have been preserved to
me. How did it happen, señora?"</p>

<p>She explained that she had seen them in
the possession of his captor, had begged that
they might be given to her, and the Indian,
thinking them of little worth, had readily
complied with her request.</p>

<p>He poured out renewed thanks as he took
up his Bible and turned over the leaves, gazing
upon it the while with loving, delighted eyes.</p>

<p>"An English book, is it not?" she asked,
watching him with mingled surprise and curiosity.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "the Book of books;
God's own holy Word. You have read it in
Spanish, señora?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Bible? We are not allowed to
touch it; our Church forbids; I never saw one
before," and she gazed upon it with a kind of
awed curiosity and interest.</p>

<p>"A Papist," he thought, pityingly;
"peradventure it was for her sake I was sent
here&mdash;that I may lead her from that darkness
into the true light. If life be spared me, I
will, with God's help, do my best."</p>

<p>She broke in upon his thoughts. "Come,
señor, eat, your fish will be quite cold."</p>

<p>When Juanita left him, carrying away
with her the remains of his repast, an old
squaw paid him a short visit, looking curiously
at him, and grunting out several questions
which were utterly unintelligible to him; he
could only shake his head and feebly sign to
her that he did not understand.</p>

<p>She left him, and he took up his book, but
found the light was not sufficient to enable
him to read, for it was a very small edition
which he had been accustomed to carry in his
pocket.</p>

<p>He was heartily glad when Juanita again
appeared, this time with the moccasin she was
embroidering in her hand, and seated herself
at his side.</p>

<p>"I am stronger to-day, señora," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
"and can listen and talk; tell me of yourself."</p>

<p>To that she answered briefly that she was
an orphan, both parents having died while she
was yet a mere infant; that she had lived in
the family of an uncle, where she was made to
feel her poverty and dependence, and her life
rendered far from happy; that some months
ago the Indians had made a raid upon her
uncle's ranch, killed him and all his family,
and carried her off a prisoner to this mountain
fastness; that she had been adopted by one of
their chiefs, Thunder-Cloud, and had no hope
of any better fate than a life spent among the
savages.</p>

<p>"Too sad a fate for one so beautiful,
señora," Rupert said; "but do not despair;
God, who rescued Daniel from the lions' den,
and Jonah from the belly of the whale, can
save us also even from this stronghold of our
savage foe."</p>

<p>"I know nothing of the occurrences you
speak of," she said, "and I dare not venture
to address any petition directly to the great
God; but I pray daily to the Blessed Virgin
and the saints to have pity upon a poor friendless
girl and restore me to my country and
my people, though, alas! I know not of one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
in whose veins flows a single drop of my
blood."</p>

<p>"Ah, señora," replied Rupert, "you need
not fear to approach the great God in the
name of His dear Son, our Lord and Saviour
Jesus Christ. He bids us do so, and tells us
that He is the hearer and answerer of prayers."</p>

<p>He paused, closed his eyes, and lifted up
his heart in silent supplication for her and for
himself.</p>

<p>She thought he slept, and sat very quietly,
busy with her embroidery and waiting for him
to wake again.</p>

<p>At length he opened his eyes, and asked
her if she knew what fate the Indians had reserved
for him.</p>

<p>She told him a council had been held while
he lay unconscious from his wounds; that
there was a heated discussion, some of the
braves being set upon putting him to a torturing
death, while others would have held him
for ransom; but finally Thunder-Cloud, whose
shot had brought him to the ground, had
claimed him as his peculiar property, and
declared his intention to adopt him as his son.
"So," she concluded, "you, señor, need
have no fear of being slain by any of the
tribe, unless caught in an attempt to escape."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"God be praised!" he ejaculated, with
clasped hands and uplifted eyes, "for life is
sweet so long as there is a possibility of future
restoration to home and loved ones."</p>

<p>"You will attempt to escape?" she asked,
with a look of apprehension; "it will be
very dangerous, señor, for they are terribly
fierce&mdash;these Apaches."</p>

<p>He looked at her with a faint smile. "I
am far too weak to think of it now, but one
day, when I have recovered my health and
strength, I may find an opportunity."</p>

<p>"And I shall be left alone with the
savages as before," she said, with a touchingly
mournful cadence in her exquisite voice.</p>

<p>"You must fly also, señora," he answered.
"I think it is to you I owe my life, for have
you not been my faithful nurse through I know
not how long a sickness? Then how could I be
so ungrateful as to leave you here in captivity
while I seek home and freedom for myself?"</p>

<p>"You have home and kindred, father and
mother perhaps, señor?" she said inquiringly,
the soft eyes she fixed upon his face wistful
and dim with unshed tears.</p>

<p>"Ah," he answered with emotion, "the
thought of their anguish when they shall learn
my fate doubles my distress."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," she sighed, "better to be alone
in the world, like me, with none to care
whether you live or die."</p>

<p>"Nay, sweet lady, there is one who cares
very much, though he has known you so short
a time," he said with a grateful look; "one
who would feel doubly desolate were you to
leave him here alone with his captors."</p>

<p class="center">"Calamity is man's true touchstone."</p>


<p class="mt2">"You have talked too much, señor,"
Juanita said with concern, noting the look of
utter exhaustion that came over his face with
the last words; "I am but a poor nurse to
have allowed it. Your lips are parched too,"
she added, dropping her work and gliding
from the tent to return a moment later with a
gourd full of the cold, sparkling water of the
mountain stream.</p>

<p>She raised his head and held the cup to
his lips.</p>

<p>He drank with feverish eagerness.</p>

<p>As he lay back upon his couch again
Juanita remarked that his wounds must be
painful and in need of dressing, adding that
Light-of-the-Morning, Thunder-Cloud's wife,
who had great knowledge of the virtues of
many plants and roots growing in that region,
would soon come in and dress them with a
certain kind of leaf that was famed among the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Indians for its healing qualities, and had
already worked wonders for him.</p>

<p>"And she has been dressing my hurts all
these days?" asked Rupert.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Ah, how long have I lain here,
señora?"</p>

<p>"Three weeks, señor," she answered, and
at that moment the old squaw he had seen before
came in bearing a bark basket filled with
the healing leaves.</p>

<p>Juanita withdrew to the farther side of the
wigwam, and seated herself with her back
toward them while Light-of-the-Morning did
her work.</p>

<p>The task was performed a trifle roughly,
but with dexterity and skill, and the applications
proved very cooling and soothing to
Rupert's wounds, which before had tortured
him with a sensation of dryness and burning
heat.</p>

<p>He returned warm thanks, Juanita acting
as interpreter.</p>

<p>The squaw nodded, her grim features relaxing
in a slight smile, as of pleasure, that her
labors were appreciated; then pointing to
Rupert's medicine case, lying by his side,
asked what it was.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>Juanita repeated the query in Spanish, and
translated Rupert's answer into Apache, which
she had learned to speak with tolerable
fluency.</p>

<p>The squaw then asked for some medicine
for a sick child in the camp, whose ailment
baffled her skill.</p>

<p>Rupert was a good druggist, and had
sufficient knowledge of medicine to prescribe
for the child when he had heard what were
the symptoms; also the proper remedy was in
his case, and he gave it. The result was satisfactory,
and raised him in the esteem of the
whole village.</p>

<p>Squaws, pappooses, a few lads and young
girls, and a sprinkling of old men were all
that were in it at this time, the braves having
gone again upon the war-path. This Rupert
learned from Juanita.</p>

<p>In a few days he was able to crawl out from
the wigwam and lie on a bearskin, which she
laid for him underneath a spreading tree. He
found the pure mountain air very delightful
and invigorating, and from that time his recovery
was rapid.</p>

<p>He was soon able to sit up a part of the day
and amuse himself with whittling bits of soft
wood, making whistles for the little Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
boys and a variety of toys for the girls&mdash;tiny
chairs, tables, spoons, knives and forks&mdash;which
greatly delighted them.</p>

<p>Thus he made friends of the children, and
also of their mothers, while to his generous
nature it was a great satisfaction to be able to
give such pleasure even to these rude children
of the desert.</p>

<p>Also, as he picked up their language, he
tried to tell them the old, old story so dear to
every Christian heart. To Juanita he was
able to tell it at once, and often as she sat by
his side during his convalescence, he read to
her passages from his Bible, stopping now and
then to give an explanation or answer a question;
for she listened with interest and a
desire to fully comprehend.</p>

<p>That his Bible had been spared to him was
a source of deep joy and thankfulness, such
comfort did he find in its many great and
precious promises.</p>

<p>His heart was often oppressed with sadness
as he thought of Don, and longed to know his
fate, or of the dear ones at home and the distress
they would undoubtedly feel on account
of his disappearance. He supposed the report
would be that he had been killed by the
Indians, and pictured to himself his mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
anguish on hearing the terrible tidings; his
father's also, for he knew that to both their
children were very near and dear.</p>

<p>When overwhelmed by these sorrowful reflections,
his only comfort was in prayer to Him
who is mighty to save, and who, he doubted
not, was able both to give consolation to his
loved ones and to deliver him from the hands
of his foes.</p>

<p>His situation was not an enviable one at
the first, but it became less so upon the return
of the braves, most of whom regarded him
with scowls and looks of hate.</p>

<p>He gave them back pleasant looks, was on
the watch to do them any little service in his
power, but avoided them when he could without
offence. As time went on he found opportunities
to win their good-will.</p>

<p>From a boy he had made a practice of
learning all that he could on every subject, and
about every kind of work that came in his
way; and now he found use for some kinds of
knowledge that most lads would think it beneath
them to acquire; and he was not only an
expert whittler, but equally accomplished as a
cook, and he taught the squaws to make savory
dishes that the braves, their husbands and
sons, loved, thus winning favor for himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet it seemed not altogether good policy;
for finding him so useful they were the more
determined never to part with him; and while
treating him well in other respects, kept him
a close prisoner in that little mountain fastness,
watching with vigilance his every movement,
and never suffering him to go out of
sight of the village.</p>

<p>Still, Rupert never for a moment faltered
in his determination to effect his escape; but
while constantly on the alert for an opportunity,
was extremely careful to do nothing
to excite suspicion that such was his purpose.</p>

<p>It was, however, no secret from Juanita,
who was to share the attempt whenever made;
and frequently when alone, plans for flight,
the direction it should take, and what provision
could be made for it, formed the principal
theme of their conversation.</p>

<p>Neither knew exactly where they were,
but Rupert had an idea that their nearest
route toward civilization would lie in a south-easterly
direction and take them into Texas.</p>

<p>He had no means of determining the matter,
nor could he for a long time do anything
more than think and plan.</p>

<p>In the mean while he tried to be useful in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
every possible way to those about him, more
especially Juanita.</p>

<p>He taught her to speak and read English,
using his Bible as his text-book; it was the
only one at hand, but it proved sufficient.
He found her deplorably ignorant of almost
everything but embroidery and music&mdash;for
which she possessed remarkable talent&mdash;but
managed, in the course of the three years they
spent in the wilds together, to give her a great
amount of general information&mdash;teaching her
many things orally&mdash;drawing maps in the sand
for her instruction in geography and history,
using the heavens at night to assist in giving
her a knowledge of astronomy, the plants and
flowers to which they had access to teach her
the rudiments of botany.</p>

<p>Juanita proved an apt pupil, bright and
interesting, readily catching an idea and retaining
it in her memory; all the more easily,
doubtless, that she dearly loved her teacher.</p>

<p>She was very young, had seen nothing of
the world, and in her artless simplicity made
her affection quite apparent to its object; but
he had no difficulty in returning it, and before
they had been six months together they
had come to a full understanding, and were
plighted lovers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Rupert drew bright pictures of his
home&mdash;the home to which he hoped one day
to take her&mdash;and of his father and mother,
brothers and sisters, all of whom he said
would welcome and love her as one of themselves.</p>

<p>But one year and then another rolled
slowly away, while deliverance seemed no
nearer than at first, and oftentimes their hearts
were sick with hope deferred.</p>

<p>It was harder for Rupert than for Juanita;
for he whom she had with her was all she had
to love, while he, though fondly attached to
the lovely girl sharing his captivity, was separated
from many who were also very dear to
his heart, and who must, he knew, be suffering
much distress of mind on his account.</p>

<p>Then, too, the enforced inactivity in business
matters was very trying to him, while she
knew nothing of it.</p>

<p>He was her world, and she had him there;
yet she did not enjoy savage life; longed to
return to civilization for her own sake, and
still more for his.</p>

<p>Besides, they were at times in great danger
when the Indians were excited by drink or
preparations to go upon the war-path, or upon
the return of the braves from such an expedition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
either exultant from victory or depressed
and angered by defeat.</p>

<p>At length, in the third year of Rupert's
captivity, the vigilance of the Indians began to
relax somewhat; they thought their prisoners
had become enamored of their wild life, and
would hardly care to risk an attempt to
escape, knowing, as they undoubtedly did,
that if recaptured torture and death would be
almost sure to follow; so Rupert and Juanita
would occasionally find themselves free to
ramble through the extent of the valley, and
even to climb some of the nearer hills and
mountains.</p>

<p>Hope now revived in their breasts, and was
quickened erelong by a fortunate discovery:
they one day came upon some small nuggets
of gold, which they carefully secreted about
their persons, with the joyful thought that it
would help them on their contemplated
journey.</p>

<p>Then, some weeks later, Rupert picked up
a stone which he felt confident was a diamond.
This too he secreted with the greatest care,
sewing it securely upon the inner side of the
deerskin hunting-shirt which he now wore day
and night, and letting no one but Juanita
know of its existence. From her he had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
concealments, for their interests were one and
the same.</p>

<p>They now watched more eagerly than ever
for the longed-for opportunity; but weeks
and months dragged on their weary way, and
it came not.</p>

<p>Another winter, with its suffering from
cold and storms, from which they were but
poorly protected in the rude huts of the
savages, passed slowly by, spring opened, and
once more the braves went forth upon the
war-path.</p>

<p>Seated together upon a ledge of rock on
the side of a mountain overlooking the Indian
village, and forming part of the barrier shutting
in the little valley from the outer world,
Rupert and Juanita watched the departure
of the Apache chiefs and braves, hideous in
their war-paint and feathers; and as the last of
them disappeared in the defile that formed the
sole entrance to this natural mountain fastness,
Rupert, turning to his companion, said, in
tones of half-tremulous eagerness and excitement,
"Juanita, love, this is our opportunity;
I doubt if we shall ever have a better."</p>

<p>"What mean you, Rupert?" she asked in
some surprise; "what will prevent Light-of-the-Morning
from watching our every moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
as vigilantly as ever? and does not old
Crouching Wildcat keep guard day and night
at the only entrance to the valley? and is he
not constantly armed and ready to shoot us
down if we so much as approach the spot
where he stands sentinel?"</p>

<p>"All quite true," returned Rupert; "yet
I have a plan; listen, maiden mine, while I
unfold it. It is that to-day and to-morrow we
make, quietly and unobserved, every preparation
in our power; then that you make a
quantity of that savory venison stew that both
Light-of-the-Morning and Crouching Wildcat
delight in, adding a little white powder which
I shall give you; let them both sup upon it,
and they will sleep soundly for some hours&mdash;so
soundly that we may steal from our wigwams,
join each other at the old warrior's side,
and pass out of the valley unmolested and unnoticed
by him."</p>

<p>"And they will wake again and suffer no
harm from the powder?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "You know, Juanita, I
would not murder them even to gain liberty
for myself and you. The powder will cause
them to sleep heavily for a time, and perhaps
make them sick for some hours after, but will
do them no permanent injury."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl's face grew radiant. "Oh,"
she cried, clasping her hands in ecstasy, "how
sweet, how delightful to be free! But why not
to-night? why should we wait another day?"</p>

<p>"That when our flight is discovered the
braves may be too far away for a messenger to
reach them with the news in time for them to
overtake us."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; you are much wiser than I;
you think of everything."</p>

<p>The braves were quite gone; the last faint
echo of their horses' hoofs had died away far
down the pass, and the squaws and children,
who had been watching their departure, scattered
to their work or play.</p>

<p>Juanita sighed; then, with a shudder,
"How many bloody scalps shall we see dangling
aloft from their spears when they come
back!" she said.</p>

<p>"Please God, we shall not be here to behold
the horrible, sickening sight," said
Rupert. Then taking her hand in his,
"Juanita, you should be my wife before we
start upon our journey."</p>

<p>She glanced up into his face half shyly,
flushing rosy red. "But how can it be?"
she asked timidly; "there is no priest here
to unite us."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will marry ourselves by Friends'
ceremony," he said; then explained it to her,
for she had never heard of it before.</p>

<p>"I fear I shall not feel married," she remarked,
in a tone of doubt and hesitation.</p>

<p>"I have the same feeling," he said,
"particularly because we have no witnesses.
But it is the best we can do now, and as soon
as we can we will be remarried by a minister.</p>

<p>"Juanita," tightening his clasp of her hand,
"I take you to be my wife, and promise to be
to you a true, faithful, and loving husband till
death do us part."</p>

<p>The beautiful eyes filled with glad tears.
"And I," she said, in low, musical tones,
"take you, Rupert, to be my lawful and
wedded husband, and promise to be to you a
true, loving, faithful, and obedient wife."</p>

<p>He put his arm about her, and drew her
into a close, tender embrace, imprinting a long
and ardent kiss upon the rich red lips. "We
are one, love," he whispered, "and what God
hath joined together shall no man put
asunder."</p>

<p>After some further discussion of their
plans they separated, and by mutual consent
were seen together less than usual during that
day and the next, so fearful were they of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
arousing suspicion of their design to attempt
an escape.</p>

<p>But late in the afternoon of the second day
Rupert contrived to give Juanita the little
morphine powder which she was to administer
to Light-of-the-Morning and Crouching
Wildcat, and to do it unperceived by any of
the Indians.</p>

<p>Juanita hastily concealed it, fastening it
into the folds of her tunic with a pin.</p>

<p>There were but few cooking utensils in the
Indian village, but Light-of-the-Morning was
the proud possessor of a little iron pot carried
off by the braves in one of their raids upon
their white neighbors, and of this Juanita was
allowed to make use in preparing the savory
stew of which Rupert had spoken.</p>

<p>When she proposed doing so to-night, the
old squaw nodded consent with a smile of approval.</p>

<p>The newly made bride went cheerily to
work, moving about with her accustomed
grace, and softly humming a snatch of song,
yet with a quaking heart as she thought of the
risk she and Rupert were now to run.</p>

<p>As he and she were to partake of the meal,
she also broiled venison and fish over the coals,
and baked bread, making her dough into long,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
slender rolls, which she then twisted round
and round a stick; that she stuck into the
ground close to the fire, and so baked the
bread, now and then pulling up the stick and
replanting it with another side to the fire.</p>

<p>Light-of-the-Morning sat watching her
with a look of great satisfaction, evidently
enjoying the feast in anticipation.</p>

<p>At length all was ready, and Juanita began
to despair of an opportunity to carry out her
design, when the squaw supplied it by seizing
a gourd and going for water for the meal.</p>

<p>She had scarcely dropped the curtain of
the wigwam behind her ere Juanita had
snatched the powder from its hiding-place and
poured it into the stew, trembling and turning
pale as she did it; for oh, how much depended
upon the success of the measure!</p>

<p>And it was an anxious moment to both
herself and Rupert when Light-of-the-Morning
first tasted of the medicated dish. She
paused, tasted again, and remarked that it was
not quite so good as usual, had a slightly
bitter taste; Juanita must have been careless
and let it scorch; but to their great relief she
went on to make a hearty meal of it, not
seeming to notice that neither of them touched
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a good deal left, and Rupert
surreptitiously carried it off to Crouching
Wildcat, who received the attention with satisfaction,
and devoured the food with great
gusto, apparently never noticing the unusual
taste of which the squaw had complained.</p>

<p>Although but little past sunset, the village
was already quiet, scarcely any one, old or
young, to be seen moving; for as a rule they
kept early hours there.</p>

<p>Juanita had purposely delayed the evening
meal in Thunder-Cloud's wigwam, rather to
the displeasure of its mistress, whose appetite
had grown very keen while waiting; a good
thing for the success of the young people's
plans, for she ate very heartily, and almost
immediately threw herself down on her couch
of skins and fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p>It was thus Rupert found her on bringing
back the vessel in which he had carried
Crouching Wildcat his portion.</p>

<p>Juanita sat beside the couch, gazing upon
the sleeper with bated breath, her hands
folded in her lap, her whole frame trembling
with excitement.</p>

<p>As Rupert pushed aside the curtain and
entered, she looked up at him, and laid her
finger upon her lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>He smiled and nodded, then stooped and
whispered in her ear, "All is already quiet; I
think we may set out as soon as it is dark
enough to gain the entrance of the pass unperceived.
Come then, love; you will find
me there."</p>

<p>Her speaking eyes gave the promise he
sought, and with a parting, half-regretful
glance at the old squaw, who had always been
kind to him and Juanita also, he left the wigwam.</p>

<p>Withdrawing to a short distance, he knelt
in the shadow of a tree and poured out his
soul in fervent prayer for guidance and help
in this perilous undertaking.</p>

<p>The shades of evening were falling fast as
he rose from his knees. He sent one swift
glance around to make sure that no human eye
was near enough to watch his movements, and,
satisfied of that, walked with rapid yet noiseless
step toward the foot of the mountain that
shut in the valley on the nearest side.</p>

<p>Ascending a little way, he came to a ledge
of rock; here stooping down and thrusting
aside the overhanging branches of a wild vine
that concealed a little hollow, he took from
thence a bundle of jerked buffalo meat and
venison, which he had collected in preparation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
for the flight, and with it in his hand rapidly
retraced his steps.</p>

<p>He paused beneath the tree he had but
just left, to take another reconnoitring
glance, and was startled to find some one leaning
against it, the faint outline of whose figure
was barely perceptible in the gathering darkness;
but only for an instant; the next he
knew it was Juanita, and his arm stole round
her waist.</p>

<p>"My love, my darling," he whispered,
"does your heart fail you?"</p>

<p>"No, beloved, not while you are with me
and lead the way," she answered softly.</p>

<p>"Come, then; I think they are all asleep,
and it is quite dark; now is our time," he
said, taking her hand and leading her onward.</p>

<p>Both had learned to walk with the Indian's
noiseless tread; they wore moccasins, and
there was no sound of footsteps as they
pursued their silent way to the mouth of the
pass.</p>

<p>Before they reached it the loud snoring of
the sentinel told them there was no danger of
molestation from him. He lay prone upon
the ground, so soundly asleep that Rupert was
able to divest him of his arms without waking
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>The gun, powder-horn, and shot-bag were
Rupert's own, which had been taken from
him at the time of his capture, so that the
most scrupulous conscience could have seen
no wrong in his taking possession; though,
indeed, had they not been his own he would
have thought it no robbery under the circumstances.</p>

<p>He was exceedingly glad to find both bag
and horn well filled, for on that largely
depended his ability to supply food for himself
and Juanita on the long journey that lay
before them ere they could reach the confines
of civilization.</p>

<p>Attaching those two articles to the belt
that confined his hunting-shirt about the waist,
and putting the gun over his shoulder, with
the bag of dried meat hung upon it, he took
Juanita's hand in his again, and led her up
the pass, away from the scene of their
captivity.</p>

<p>It was very dark in that narrow defile,
with the mountains towering far above them
on each side, and the way was narrow, rough,
and stony; again and again they stumbled
and were near falling, yet held each other up;
but they pressed patiently, determinately onward,
without pause or exchange of word or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
syllable, till they reached the end, and came
out upon a wide open plain.</p>

<p>The newly-risen moon, flooding it with
silver light, showed them something of its
nature and extent; it was treeless and, except
along the margin of a stream that crossed
it, a sandy waste. It did not look inviting,
but across it lay the path to freedom, home,
and friends.</p>

<p>They paused but a moment to recover
breath and take in the view by one sweeping
glance from side to side, then pressed forward
more rapidly than had been possible in the
darkness of the defile from which they had
just emerged.</p>

<p>"Thank God, there is no foe in sight!"
ejaculated Rupert, "but we must make all
haste across this plain; for if pursued we can
be seen from a great distance. Also let us
gain yonder stream as quickly as possible, and
walk in the water to destroy the scent of our
footsteps, and leave no mark of a trail, by
which we can be tracked."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," panted Juanita; "oh, let us
hasten."</p>

<p>"My poor darling, you are already almost
spent," Rupert said tenderly. "Lean on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
me. If I were but free of the gun and bag of
meat, I would take you in my arms."</p>

<p>"No, no," she returned, with a little
pleased laugh. "I should not allow it. I
am but a trifle out of breath; that is all, my
best of husbands."</p>

<p>"I am happy to hear it," he said, "for I
fear your strength will be sorely tried before
we can reach a place of safety. Draw your
blanket more closely about you, for the night
wind has full sweep across this open plain, and
its cold is piercing."</p>

<p>They had both been forced to adopt the Indian
style of dress; Juanita had neither cloak
nor shawl, but wore a blanket wrapped about
her shoulders, after the manner of the squaws.</p>

<p>She drew it closer, took Rupert's arm, and
they sped swiftly over the plain, the sense of
impending danger lending them unnatural
strength and speed.</p>

<p>They reached the stream, and followed its
course for some miles, keeping just within
the water's edge, then left it for a more direct
route, which brought them, about daylight, to
a dense forest.</p>

<p>Being now utterly spent with fatigue, they
were obliged to stop and take some rest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
Rupert spread his blanket at the foot of a tree,
made Juanita lie down upon it, and carefully
covered her with his own. "My poor child,
how very weary you are!" he sighed in tender
accents.</p>

<p>"Ah, if I could but provide a cup of hot
coffee and a good warm breakfast for your refreshment!
But I have nothing to offer you
but this dried venison, and dare not even
kindle a fire to dry your wet feet, lest the
smoke should attract the attention of our
savage foes."</p>

<p>"Ah," she said, with a determined effort
to be cheerful, and giving him a sweet, bright
smile, "we will not mind such trifles, if only
we may escape being recaptured. Give me a
bit of the venison; I can eat it with appetite."</p>

<p>They rested and slept where they were for
some hours; then, late in the afternoon,
started on again through the forest, trying to
keep a south-easterly direction, and guided by
the sun, of which they caught occasional
glimpses between the tall tree-tops.</p>

<p>About the time of his setting they came
out upon a little opening in the forest; and
here they halted, made another meal upon the
dried meat, then lay down and slept until the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
moon rose, when they pressed on again,
guided by her light.</p>

<p>So for many weeks they journeyed on, the
sun guiding them by day, the moon and stars
at night, sometimes, when clouds covered
these from view, obliged to lie by for hours
or days; often compelled to do so from utter
weakness and weariness, drinking water from
the streams, and satisfying their hunger upon
fish caught in them, or such game as Rupert
was able to bring down with his gun or catch
in snares laid for them when he and Juanita
stopped for a night's rest.</p>

<p>He kept an account of the days of the
week, and was careful to observe the rest of
the Sabbath. He had brought his Bible with
him, and the greater part of the day would be
passed in the study of its pages and prayer to
that God who is everywhere present and able
to deliver from all dangers and fears. Rupert
and Juanita were in a situation to feel very
sensibly the need of His protecting care; for
danger from wild beasts and roving bands of
Indians threatened them on every side; venomous
reptiles, too, often lay in their path, and
they were not seldom assailed by both hunger
and thirst, sometimes travelling many, many
miles without finding either food or water.</p></div>

<p>It was late in the afternoon of a sultry
August day that our poor travellers, footsore
and weary, reached a great cattle ranch in
Texas, owned and occupied by a family of the
name of Baird, who had emigrated from Ohio
years before.</p>

<p>Their large, comfortable house, separated
from the road by a wide, grassy yard and
flower-garden, was the first civilized dwelling
Rupert and Juanita had seen since their capture
by the Indians, and their pulses quickened
with joy at the sight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baird was getting supper for her husband
and sons, all of whom were in the field
with the cattle. Turning from the fire where
she was broiling chickens, baking biscuit, and
frying potatoes, she caught sight of two forlorn
figures coming up the garden path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Injuns!" she cried aloud, as, pale and
breathless with fright, she looked this way
and that for some weapon of defence, "and
me here alone!"</p>

<p>But a second glance reassured her. They
were nearing the open door, and she could
see not only that they were whites, but that
there was nothing sinister or fierce in the expression
of the man's face, while that of the
young girl, though pale and travel-stained,
was winsome and even beautiful.</p>

<p>She stepped forward with a cordial "How
d'ye do? Walk in, and sit down, and rest,
for you are dreadfully tired, I know," setting
out some chairs as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Thank you, madam; indeed we are,"
Rupert replied, lifting his hat with a courtly
bow.</p>

<p>But as they crossed the threshold Juanita
staggered, and would have fallen had not he
caught her in his arms.</p>

<p>"Oh, my darling, my darling!" he cried
in tones of acute distress, "have food and rest
come too late for you?"</p>

<p>"Food and rest?" repeated Mrs. Baird,
greatly shocked, "is she starved? Here,
lay her down quick on the lounge in the sitting-room,
and I'll bring her a glass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
milk at once; 'twont take me a minute to
get it."</p>

<p>With a word of thanks Rupert followed
the good woman's directions, and had scarcely
done so ere she was at his side with the milk.</p>

<p>He raised Juanita's head. Mrs. Baird held
the glass to her lips, and noted, with tears of
mingled joy and compassion, the eagerness
with which it was swallowed.</p>

<p>Then a sudden thought sent her flying
from the room to return immediately with a
pitcher, from which she filled the glasses again
and again, first for Juanita, then for Rupert.</p>

<p>"Now," she said, when her pitcher was
empty, "you shall both have a good hearty
supper in about ten minutes. If you'd like to
wash off the dust first, you'll find soap, water,
and towels handy out there on the porch.
Now I must leave you, or my supper will be
all spoiled."</p>

<p>"O Rupert, how good and kind she is!"
whispered Juanita, with tears in her eyes, as
their hostess left them alone together, "and
she could never suppose from our appearance
that we have anything to pay with."</p>

<p>"No; she must be a truly benevolent
woman, and a Christian one also, I think; and
truly we have great reason to thank our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
heavenly Father for bringing us to such an
one in our sore need," said Rupert, adding, as
Juanita made a movement as if to rise, "Lie
still, love; I will bring a basin of water to
you."</p>

<p>"Please do," she answered, lying down
again; "a wash will be very refreshing. Ah,
if one only had some clean clothes to put
on!"</p>

<p>"That desire also shall be granted before
long, my darling," Rupert answered between
a tear and a smile, glancing down rather ruefully
at the worn and soiled garments of his
pretty young wife.</p>

<p>He had shielded her as far as possible from
the hardnesses of their terrible journey, yet
he knew that her sufferings had been great&mdash;so
great that his kind, loving heart bled at the
very thought of them.</p>

<p>She had beautiful hair, very fine, soft,
glossy and black as the raven's wing; very
long and luxuriant too; when unconfined
falling in a great mass of ringlets below her
waist.</p>

<p>Rupert was very proud of it, as well as of
her regular and delicate features, her starry
eyes, sylphlike form, and graceful movements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>At present she wore her hair in a great
coil at the back of her shapely head, held in
place by a wooden pin that he had made for
her.</p>

<p>"May I take this down and comb it out
for you?" he asked, laying his hand caressingly
upon it. "But perhaps it would tire
you too much."</p>

<p>"Oh no, it would rather be a refreshment,"
she answered, smiling up at him,
"and I shall be much obliged."</p>

<p>So he did, then brought her the water to
lave her hands and face.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mrs. Baird, busy with her
preparations for the evening meal, was full of
curiosity in regard to her unexpected guests.
"Who can they be?" she questioned with
herself, "and where in the world did they
come from? It's as plain as day that he's a
gentleman and she a lady; they look it in
spite of their odd, shabby dress; and they
speak good, pure English in refined tones,
though she has a little foreign accent. She
looks Spanish, but he's an American; I'm
sure of that. Shouldn't wonder if he's from
my own State&mdash;from that section anyway, for
he's neither a New Englander nor a Southerner.
But their dress&mdash;why, it's nearer Injun<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
than anything else; well, now I wonder&mdash;"
and hurrying to the sitting-room door she
addressed Rupert:</p>

<p>"If you please, sir, I'd like to ask a
question. Have you been among the Injuns?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he said; "we escaped about three
months ago from an Apache village, where we
had been prisoners for three years."</p>

<p>"Dear me! how dreadful! And that
must have been a long way off; how did you
ever get here?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it must be hundreds of miles, and
we have walked all the way."</p>

<p>"Oh you poor things!" she cried, the
tears coursing down her cheeks; "no wonder
you're completely worn out. Your sufferings
must have been dreadful."</p>

<p>"They have not been small," Rupert said,
with emotion, his glance resting pityingly for
an instant upon Juanita's wan features; "but
as our days, our strength has been, for God is
faithful to His promises. And now," he
added, with a brightening countenance, "the
worst is all over, I trust."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; you must stay here till
you're quite rested," she said, with cordial
hospitality. "And as soon as there's a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
chance I'd like to hear your whole story. It
can't fail to be interesting."</p>

<p>Turning hastily away with the last word,
she seized a tin horn, and going to the back
door blew a vigorous blast.</p>

<p>Her husband, three stalwart sons grown to
man's estate, and a slender lad of twelve, the
youngest and therefore the family pet, came
hurrying from the field in answer to the summons.</p>

<p>The wife and mother met them at the
threshold, her still fresh and comely face full
of excitement. "We have guests," she said.</p>

<p>"Who on earth, mother?" ejaculated
Joe, the eldest son, while his father remarked,
"They're welcome, whoever they are, if
they're honest, decent folks."</p>

<p>"That I'll engage they are!" she
answered, "though their clothes are shabby
enough; but they're escaped captives from
the Apaches; have been travelling through
the wilderness for months on foot, and of
course are in a very bad plight."</p>

<p>Her announcement was met by various exclamations
of surprise and commiseration, according
to the characters and dispositions of
the speakers.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "and of course, father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
we'll keep them here till they're rested, poor
things, and then help them on their way to
their friends, if they have any."</p>

<p>"Of course, of course, wife," answered
the man of the house, cheerily. "But where
are they?"</p>

<p>"In the sitting-room. Go in and speak
to them, won't you? and ask them out to supper;
it's just ready."</p>

<p>"I'll do that!" he said, hanging up the
towel he had been using.</p>

<p>In another minute he was shaking hands
cordially with Rupert, while congratulating
him on his escape from the Indians, and
assuring him and Juanita of their welcome to
the hospitalities of the ranch as long as they
might be pleased to accept them. "No obligations,
young man," he said, interrupting
Rupert's expression of thanks; "you'd do
the same for me if our situations were reversed;
and besides, any decent stranger is a
godsend in these lonely parts; and the cost of
entertaining, where you have everything on
your place and no market for it, is just about
nothing. Come, walk out to supper," he
added; "it's on the table, and best while it's
hot."</p>

<p>He led the way, and they followed right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
willingly, for the smell of the viands was extremely
appetizing, and the milk had by no
means appeased their hunger.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baird greeted them with a smile,
pointed out their seats, and with an inclination
of the head toward the younger members of
the family, said, "My sons, Mr&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keith," supplied Rupert, as she paused
with an inquiring look at him; "Rupert
Keith is my name, and this young lady,"
glancing at Juanita, "is&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was an instant's hesitation, then he
added, "my wife," coloring slightly as he
spoke.</p>

<p>He was conscious of a furtive exchange of
wondering, inquiring glances among his entertainers,
but no remark was made.</p>

<p>They all sat down to the table, the father
asked a blessing upon the food, and the meal
began.</p>

<p>Presently Rupert said, with a frank look
into the face of his host, "I must ask to be
permitted to explain my hesitation of a moment
ago.</p>

<p>"Juanita and I have been fellow-captives
among the Apaches. They carried her off in
a raid into Mexico&mdash;her native land. Me they
captured on my way from Indiana to California,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
and we made our acquaintance in the
Indian village.</p>

<p>"It was not long before we became
lovers, but there was no one there to unite us
in marriage. Just previous to making our
escape we married ourselves by Friends' ceremony,
as the best we could do; but having
had no witnesses, we do not feel quite satisfied
that the knot has been tied as tightly as it
ought to be (the reason of my hesitation to
claim her as fully mine)," he put in parenthetically
and with a look and smile of ardent affection
directed to his bride, "and as soon as
we can come across a minister we will get him
to tighten it," he concluded, with a half-sportive
look and tone. Then, more gravely,
"Is there one in this neighborhood?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>All present had listened with evident interest
to his explanation; the father of the
family now answered, "None very near, but
there's a Methodist minister of the name of
Clark, who passes here every other Sunday on
his way to a school-house six miles beyond,
where he preaches. He generally takes his
dinner here, and that will be a good chance for
you, if you can wait for it."</p>

<p>"'Twon't be so long, father," remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
his wife, cheerily; "this is Friday, and next
Sunday is Mr. Clark's day."</p>

<p>"Why, to be sure, so it is!" ejaculated
her spouse, turning a beaming face upon
Rupert and Juanita.</p>

<p>"We can wait," Juanita said in her liquid
tones, speaking for the first time since she had
sat down to the table. "I am but poorly
prepared so far as regards my dress," she
added, with blushing cheek and a shy, downward
glance at her forlorn attire.</p>

<p>Rupert gave her a tenderly sympathizing
look, then turning to their host asked, "Is
there any place within reach where clothing
may be procured? I have means to pay for
it, and we are both, as you see, sorely in need
of it."</p>

<p>"The nearest place is twenty miles away,
and it's none of the best," was the discouraging
reply. "However, we'll see what can be
done; Joe can drive you over to-morrow, if
you feel like taking the trip; but I should
think you'd better rest a few days first."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I should think so," chimed
in Mrs. Baird; "and Joe can lend him a
suit to be married in (they look to be pretty
near of a size), and I'll find something for the
young lady."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly!" assented Joe with
ready cordiality and a kindly look at Rupert,
who was beaming with joy and gratitude.</p>

<p>"You are all exceedingly kind," he said
with emotion.</p>

<p>And truly he and Juanita looked in need
of such kindly offices. They were dressed
almost exactly alike&mdash;in full suits of deerskin,
moccasins, leggings, and a long loose shirt
belted in at the waist; all much worn and
soiled with months of constant wear and the
dust of travel. On their arrival each had
worn a broad-brimmed hat woven by Juanita's
deft fingers.</p>

<p>Their entertainers, though eager to hear the
story of their captivity and subsequent wanderings,
kindly refrained from questioning them
till their appetites had been fully satisfied.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the meal Juanita was
made to lie down again, Mrs. Baird insisting
that she must be altogether too tired to sit
up; Rupert was given an arm-chair, and all
the family gathered round him to listen to a
lengthened narrative of his experiences from
the time of his capture to the present.</p>

<p>Some passages were so moving that there
was not a dry eye in the room, and tender-hearted
Mrs. Baird sobbed aloud.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>When the story seemed to have come to an
end she started up, saying, "Dear me! I've
left my dishes standing all this while!" and
hastily left the room.</p>

<p>Her husband and sons remained, and plied
Rupert with questions.</p>

<p>"What have you done with your gun?"
asked Ralph, the youngest. "You said you
had one that you stole back from that old
Wildcat, but I haven't noticed it anywhere
round."</p>

<p>"No," Rupert said; "when we came in
sight of this house I felt safe in getting rid of
the burden of carrying it for a while. Our
blankets too; we were so tired and the sun so
hot, that they seemed an almost intolerable
load, so I hid them in a clump of bushes a
little off the roadside, where I knew I could
easily find them again."</p>

<p>"That was wise," remarked his host;
"we will go for them in the morning."</p>

<p>"Did that old Wildcat and the rest chase
after you?" queried Ralph.</p>

<p>"Indeed, my little man, I do not know,"
replied Rupert. "If so, it was when it was
too late for them to overtake us."</p>

<p>"I think you managed splendidly," remarked
Tom, the second son.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think God helped and took care of us,"
Rupert said, with reverent gratitude.</p>

<p>"And there you are right," said his host.
"'Except the Lord build the house, they
labor in vain that build it: except the Lord
keep the city, the watchman waketh but in
vain.'"</p>

<p>"Words of inspiration," Rupert said,
recognizing them with a smile of glad content.
"I perceive that we are fellow-servants of the
same divine Master, and much I thank Him
for bringing me to the house of one of His
followers for a short season of rest."</p>

<p>"And most welcome you are, sir, especially
as belonging to Him," returned Mr.
Baird, heartily; "'Inasmuch as ye have done
it unto one of the least of these my brethren,
ye have done it unto me.' Those words of
His make it a double delight to do any kindness
to one of His disciples."</p>

<p>All this time Juanita had been soundly
sleeping; her head had scarcely touched the
pillow ere she was lost to all that was going
on about her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baird, coming in again, noticed that
Rupert seemed very weary.</p>

<p>"You are making Mr. Keith talk too
much," she said to the others. "He's fairly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
tired out, and ought to be sleeping this
minute. I'll make up a bed directly for you,
and one for her," she added, addressing
Rupert, and glancing toward Juanita with the
last words.</p>

<p>"Oh no, do not give yourself the
trouble," he hastened to say; "I doubt if
either of us could sleep in a bed after being so
long used to nothing softer than a bear or
buffalo skin spread upon the ground."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baird gave him a puzzled look.
"What can I do for you then?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Give me an old quilt or something of the
kind, if you have one conveniently at hand,
and I will lie on the floor here."</p>

<p>"Yes; I'll get you a quilt and a couple of
buffalo robes," she said, "though I'd rather
give you a good bed. I may make up one for
her, mayn't I?"</p>

<p>Rupert smiled, and with a loving glance at
Juanita said, "I really think she would prefer
to stay where she is till to-morrow morning.
She will probably sleep on till then
without moving or so much as opening an eye,
she is so very weary, poor thing!"</p>

<p>"And," with a little doubtful hesitation,
"you wouldn't rather have separate rooms?
I have plenty of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>"No; she is my wife, and we have been
together night and day ever since our escape
from captivity; and she has slept close at my
side or in my arms. How could I have it
otherwise, with the growl of the bear, the
savage howl of the wolf, or the scream of the
wildcat in our ears, to say nothing of constant
danger from roving bands of Indians?"</p>

<p>"Sure enough, sir; and she is your wife!
Well, it shall be just as you wish, though it
does seem like treating you both very inhospitably."</p>

<p>"Not at all, my dear madam. In fact,
neither of us would be willing to get into one
of your nice clean beds without a bath and
change of raiment, which we cannot have at
present."</p>

<p>"Why, yes you can, of course," put in
Joe; "we have a bath-room, and I'll supply
you with a change of clothes, without waiting
for the Rev. Mr. Clark's coming," he added,
with a good-humored laugh.</p>

<p>"And I'll do the same by your wife to-morrow
morning," said the mother, as she
hurried away in search of the quilt.</p>

<p>She kept her word, and Juanita appeared
at the breakfast-table very agreeably metamorphosed
by civilized garments, though the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
calico dress was a little faded, and had to be
belted in about the waist because it was
several sizes too large.</p>

<p>But no attire, however uncouth, could hide
the gracefulness of her form and movements,
or mar the beauty of her face.</p>

<p>"They won't come anywhere near fitting,
you are so much more slender than I am,"
Mrs. Baird had remarked when offering
them, "but at least they are sweet and clean
as soap and water can make them."</p>

<p>"The best possible recommendation, dear
lady," Juanita answered, with a joyous smile.
"Oh, you do not know how glad I shall be to
be clean once more! You could only learn
by living in a wigwam for three years and
then travelling through the woods and over
the mountains and prairies in the one suit,
wearing it day and night."</p>

<p>"A great deal more than I should be
willing to pay for the knowledge," returned
her hostess between a smile and a tear.
"You poor young thing! What a fearful
time you must have had!"</p>

<p>Rupert's appearance had undergone quite
as great an improvement as Juanita's, and
they exchanged many admiring glances during
the meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterward, when they found themselves
alone together for a moment, "How lovely
you are this morning, my darling!" exclaimed
Rupert, catching Juanita in his arms and
giving her a rapturous embrace.</p>

<p>"You too," she said, laying one small
hand on each of his broad shoulders and gazing
fondly up into his face.</p>

<p>"It's the clothes&mdash;altogether the clothes
in my case, I fear," he returned, half laughingly;
"savage attire is none too becoming
to me."</p>

<p>"Nor to me," she responded; "it's the
change of dress with me as well as with you.
But oh, my Rupert, I have always thought
you the handsomest of men, even in savage
attire!"</p>

<p>"Little flatterer!" he said, laughing and
pinching her cheek, yet evidently not ill
pleased with the compliment. "That dress is
extremely becoming; really you are positively
bewitching in it."</p>

<p>"Ah, who is the flatterer now?" she cried,
clapping her hands and laughing gleefully.</p>

<p>Ralph looked in at the door. "Mr.
Keith, father says would you like to come and
look at some of our fine cattle, if you are not
too tired?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I should, thank you,"
Rupert answered, letting go of Juanita to
follow the boy, but turning back again to
kiss her good-by and bid her take all the rest
she could.</p>

<p>"Thanks, señor," she returned gayly,
"but I feel quite fresh this morning, and I
must see if I cannot give a little help to our
kind hostess. She seems to have no servant,
and our presence here must add to her
labors."</p>

<p>"Quite right," he said, with an approving
smile, "but do not overtax your
strength."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baird was not in the kitchen, where
Juanita expected to find her, but hearing the
light step of the latter, called to her from an
inner room.</p>

<p>"Come here, my dear," she said, "and
tell me what you think of this."</p>

<p>It was a white dress of fine cambric muslin,
its skirt, waist, and sleeves elaborately
trimmed with tiny tucks, embroidery, and
lace. Mrs. Baird held it up to view, repeating
her query, "What do you think of this?"</p>

<p>"That it is very pretty," Juanita answered,
examining it closely. "What beautifully
fine needlework."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; it's a dress I had when I was married,"
remarked Mrs. Baird. "I was a bit
of a slender girl then, as you are now. I
never wore it much, and after a while I grew
too stout for it. I thought of it last night
when considering what could be found for you
to wear to-morrow, so I've just been rummaging
through these bureau drawers in search
of it.</p>

<p>"Of course it must be very old-fashioned,
and it's very yellow with lying by so long;
but there won't be anybody here that knows
about the fashions, or will mind that it isn't
as white as it should be. So if you are willing
to wear it just try it on to see if it comes anywhere
near fitting, and if it does I'll have it
in the washtub in a trice; and I really think it
won't look so badly when I'm done with it."</p>

<p>"How very kind you are, dear lady!"
exclaimed Juanita, catching Mrs. Baird's hand
and kissing it, her face all aglow with delight
and gratitude. "It is lovely! and I shall not
care at all for the fashion or for a little yellowness,
which will make the lace look all the
richer."</p>

<p>"Then put it on, my dear," Mrs. Baird
said, smilingly; "and you need not feel over-burdened
with gratitude for so small a favor."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>It proved not a bad fit, and both thought
would do extremely well without alteration.</p>

<p>"Now if you only had a decent pair of
shoes," remarked Mrs. Baird reflectively;
"but those I'm afraid I can't supply, for any
of mine would be a mile too large for that
pretty little foot of yours."</p>

<p>"Ah! which would you advise, dear lady,
bare feet or these?" Juanita asked, with a
rueful laugh and a downward glance at her
worn and soiled moccasins.</p>

<p>"Moccasins!" exclaimed Mrs. Baird,
struck by a sudden thought. "You've been
so long among the Injuns, have you learned
to make them, and could you make yourself a
pair if you had the materials?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" was the eager rejoinder,
"for myself and Rupert too."</p>

<p>"Then you shall have them," said the
good woman, beginning to rummage again
among her stores. "I have a nice soft
doeskin that will be just the thing. Ah, here it
is!" pulling it down from a high closet shelf;
"and I have some colored silks you can have
for embroidering with if you like."</p>

<p>"Thank you, oh a thousand thanks!"
Juanita said, "but the skin is all I want; I
prefer the moccasins plain for this occasion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
especially as I can make them up so much
more quickly. But may I not first help you
with your work? I can wash dishes, and
sweep, and dust, and make beds."</p>

<p>"No, no, my dear!" Mrs. Baird said, in
her bright, cheery way; "you shall do nothing
of the kind. It is very kind and thoughtful&mdash;your
offering to do it&mdash;but I really don't
need help, and you must sit right down to
those moccasins. If you like to sit in the
kitchen while I'm busy there, I'll be very
glad of your company."</p>

<p>Before sunset Juanita's bridal attire was
quite ready, and she exhibited it to Rupert's
admiring eyes with perhaps as much pride
and satisfaction as a city belle might have
taken in her silks and satins.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Baird says the dress is old-fashioned
and not a good color&mdash;" began Juanita.</p>

<p>"But what difference does that make, my
sweet?" interrupted Rupert; "who of us
will know the difference? And I am sure you
will look very lovely, at least in the bridegroom's
eyes, and in fact will be better
dressed than he," he added gayly. "I hope
you won't be ashamed of him."</p>

<p>"Never, never! but proud, very proud!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
she cried, throwing an arm about his neck and
laying her head on his breast.</p>

<p>"Not prouder than I of my bride," he
said softly, caressing her tenderly.</p>

<p>They were interrupted by the call to supper,
and scarcely had the meal begun when a
horseman rode up to the gate, dismounted,
fastened his horse as if quite at home, then
came hurrying up the path toward the open
door.</p>

<p>There was a simultaneous exclamation from
several voices, "Why, there's Mr. Clark," and
the whole family rose to greet him with a
hearty handshake and words of welcome.</p>

<p>Then Rupert and Juanita were introduced,
another plate was added to the table, a chair
set up for the new arrival, and he warmly invited
to share their meal.</p>

<p>He was not slow to accept the invitation,
and did ample justice to the viands, praising
them without stint as he ate.</p>

<p>"You're the best cook in the county, by
all odds, Mrs. Baird; but the Ohio ladies are
very apt to understand the business; I don't
believe there's a State in the Union can beat
Ohio at that."</p>

<p>"I agree with you there, sir," remarked
Rupert. "But I have observed that a man is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
very apt to think nobody else's cooking quite
equal to that of his own mother&mdash;a fact partly
to be accounted for by the other, that children's
appetites are usually keen and their
digestion good. There is a great deal of truth
in the old saying that hunger is the best sauce."</p>

<p>"Was your mother a native of Ohio, Mr.
Keith?" asked Mrs. Baird, with a look of interest.</p>

<p>"Yes, madam, my father also; all their
children were born there too, so that we are
a family of Buckeyes," he concluded, with
sportive look and tone.</p>

<p>"I thought so!" she exclaimed emphatically;
"the first hour you were in the house I
said to myself, I shouldn't wonder if he were
from my own State of Ohio."</p>

<p>"But I thought I heard you say you came
from Indiana, Mr. Keith," spoke up Ralph.</p>

<p>"So I did," returned Rupert, pleasantly;
"we removed to that State some years ago."</p>

<p>"Fine States both," remarked Mr. Clark.
"I've lived in both, and ought to know. Now
confess, Mrs. Baird, that you are wondering
what brought me here to-day."</p>

<p>"To be ready for preaching to-morrow, I
presume," she answered dryly; "but why
should I be wondering more than the rest?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, woman's curiosity, you know, if
you'll excuse the jest; for I really don't believe
you're one bit more curious about it than
anybody else here. Well, I had a funeral to
attend this morning some six or seven miles
from this, and then two or three sick folks to
visit a little nearer here, and I thought it
wouldn't be worth while to go back home
before Monday. You see, I always feel sure
of a welcome at Baird's Ranch."</p>

<p>"That's right; you need never have the
least doubt of it," said his host. "And we
are particularly glad to see you this time, because
there's a job waiting for you here."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" cried the minister, elevating
his eyebrows in surprise; "and what may it
be? Has one of these fine boys of yours
selected a wife, and is he wanting me to tie
the knot?"</p>

<p>"Ah, your guess is not very wide of the
mark," laughed Mr. Baird, "though the
wedding will not be exactly in the family."</p>

<p>"There, father, that will do for the
present," remarked his wife, perceiving that
Juanita was blushing in a slightly embarrassed
way; "we have the whole evening before us,
and it won't take long to make all the necessary
arrangements."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have not been long in this part of
the country I presume, sir?" Mr. Clark said,
inquiringly, addressing Rupert.</p>

<p>"I arrived only yesterday, sir," was the
reply.</p>

<p>"Direct from Indiana?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, direct from the Apache country,
where I have been a prisoner for three
years."</p>

<p>"Is it possible, sir! You must have had
a dreadful experience."</p>

<p>And then questions and answers followed
in rapid succession, Mr. Clark almost forgetting
to eat in the intense interest he felt in the
story Rupert and Juanita had to tell; for
learning from something said by one of the
family that she had shared Rupert's captivity,
he catechised her also quite closely.</p>

<p>He was captivated by her beauty and her
modest, sensible replies, and being presently
able to make a shrewd conjecture as to who
were to claim his services that evening,
thought Rupert a very fortunate man.</p>

<p>Mrs. Baird made short work of clearing
away the remains of the supper and setting
everything to rights. Then taking two of her
sons with her, she repaired to the garden.</p>

<p>All three presently returned laden with
flowers, with which they proceeded to ornament
the parlor, after setting aside some of the
fairest and most fragrant for the adornment of
the bride.</p>

<p>"What next, mother?" asked Tom.
"You are hardly thinking of having a wedding
in the house without refreshments, I
suppose?"</p>

<p>"No; I've plenty of cake baked: three
kinds&mdash;bride, pound, and sponge cakes. Now
you boys go to the garden and gather all the
finest fruits you can find, while I help the
bride to dress."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dress?" laughed Tom; "what has she
to dress in? Will she put on her Indian toggery
again?"</p>

<p>"You'll see when the time comes," said
his mother. "Now off with you, and show
how well you can do your part."</p>

<p>Mr. Baird had repaired to the front porch
with his guests, and an animated conversation
was going on there, Mr. Clark and Rupert
being the chief speakers, when the good lady
of the house appeared among them with the
announcement that it was time for every one
of them to be dressing for the wedding.</p>

<p>"You know your room, Mr. Clark. I've
had your saddlebags carried there, and you'll
find everything necessary for making your
toilet. Mr. Baird, will you please to attend
to Mr. Keith? I shall take care of the
bride." And linking Juanita's arm in hers
she led her into the house and to a large, airy
bedroom that, with its white draped windows,
toilet-table, and bed, looked very suitable for
a bridal chamber.</p>

<p>The white dress, the new moccasins, and
a profusion of loveliest flowers were there.</p>

<p>Juanita sent a swift glance about the room,
taking in all these details and more (the room
seemed pervaded by a simple air of elegance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
and its atmosphere was redolent of the sweet
breath of the flowers); then turning to her
kind hostess, threw her arms round her neck,
and with quivering lips and eyes full of tears
said, "Oh, how good, how good you are to a
poor wayfarer, dear lady!"</p>

<p>"It's very little I'm doing, dear child,"
said Mrs. Baird, returning the embrace.
"I'm afraid it must seem but a forlorn kind
of wedding to you; and yet I think you
should be a happy bride, for sure I am that
if you are not a happy wife it will not be the
fault of the man you are marrying."</p>

<p>"No," cried Juanita, smiles chasing
away the tears, "there cannot be another in
all the world like my Rupert."</p>

<p>"I must own that I have taken a great
fancy to him," Mrs. Baird said, smiling and
stroking Juanita's hair caressingly. "Now,
dear, let me help you to dress. I want the
pleasure of arranging this beautiful hair and
trimming it with flowers. They are the most
suitable ornament for a bride, and fortunately
we have an abundant supply."</p>

<p>"Yes, I prefer them to jewels," said
Juanita.</p>

<p>"My dear, you look lovely!" was the
delighted exclamation of the good lady when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
her labors were completed. "Simple and
old-fashioned as the dress is, it becomes you
wonderfully. I never saw a bride in the
richest white silk or satin look half so beautiful
as you do in it."</p>

<p>"Ah, you flatter me, my kind friend!"
Juanita said, with a blush that enhanced her
charms.</p>

<p>"Now sit down for a few minutes while I
trim the room with the rest of these roses,
lilies, and orange blossoms," said her hostess,
"and then I'll go and send Mr. Keith to stay
with you till I call you to the parlor."</p>

<p>"Ah, may I not help? I would rather,"
Juanita said, half imploringly. "Dear lady,
you must be quite exhausted with the many
labors of the day."</p>

<p>"No, no, not at all," laughed Mrs. Baird
gayly; "as my husband often says, I have a
wonderful capacity for work. I really do believe
it was what I was made for."</p>

<p>"You are never ill?"</p>

<p>"No, never; and what a cause for thankfulness!
What earthly blessing greater than
good health?"</p>

<p>A little later Rupert came in to find
Juanita alone, seated before the window, gazing
out upon a beautiful landscape of prairie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
and forest, with richly wooded hills in the distance.</p>

<p>He stepped lightly across the floor, but her
quick ear caught the sound of his footfalls.
She turned, rose hastily, and threw herself
into his outstretched arms.</p>

<p>"My beautiful! my beautiful!" he said,
softly, holding her close with tenderest
caresses.</p>

<p>"Ah, my love, my love, I would I were
ten times more beautiful for your dear sake,"
she responded, gazing into his face with eyes
full of happy tears.</p>

<p>"That would be quite impossible," he
said, holding her off a little, the better to view
her charms, then drawing her close again to
repeat his caresses.</p>

<p>So happy in each other were they that the
time did not seem long till they were summoned
to the parlor, where the whole Baird
family and the minister were in waiting.</p>

<p>It was a short, simple, yet impressive
ceremony, and the spectators, though few in
number, were very hearty and sincere in their
congratulations at its close. Rupert felt that
all he needed to complete his happiness was
the presence of his parents, brothers, and
sisters&mdash;all, alas, so far away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span></p>

<p>He was very eager to reach home, but so
weary were both he and Juanita that he had
already decided to accept the kind invitation
of these new-found friends to stay some weeks
with them. Also it was absolutely necessary
they should make some preparation, in the
matter of dress, for a decent appearance in
civilized society.</p>

<p>The table spread by Mrs. Baird and her
sons with the simple wedding feast of cake and
fruits, garnished with a profusion of beautiful,
fragrant flowers, presented a most attractive
appearance; nor were its delicacies found
less agreeable to the palate than satisfying to
the eye.</p>

<p>There was no revel, no intoxicating drink,
though a great abundance of delicious lemonade,
nor was the feasting prolonged to excess;
there was in fact more talk than eating
and drinking, and at a primitively early hour
all had retired, each to his own room.</p>

<p>"At last, love, we know beyond a question
that we are truly husband and wife," Rupert
said, holding Juanita to his heart with tenderest
caresses. "Does the certainty add to
your happiness, as it does to mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes," she murmured, softly; "oh, I am
happier than ever before in all my life!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, it makes my heart glad to hear it!
How proud I shall be to show my little wife
to the dear ones at home. I hope to have an
opportunity on Monday to send them a few
lines to tell that I am yet alive and hope to
be with them in a few weeks."</p>

<p>He availed himself of that opportunity,
writing to Dr. Landreth to break the news to
his parents, but the letter never reached its
destination. Hence the intense surprise of his
relatives when he arrived among them.</p>

<p>The remainder of the journey was performed
in comparative comfort. Rupert
bought a pair of stout mules and a roomy
wagon, which he and the hospitable Bairds
stocked with everything necessary for a
journey of several hundred miles through a
sparsely settled country.</p>

<p>In this the young couple travelled to New
Orleans, stopping at night at some village,
farmhouse, or ranch, when any such shelter
was near, at other times unharnessing and
tethering their mules and sleeping in their
wagon.</p>

<p>The parting with the Bairds was a sorrowful
one on both sides, for they had become
sincerely attached during the weeks spent together,
and it was very unlikely they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
ever meet again on earth. Their only consolation
was in the strong hope and expectation
of a final reunion in another and better
world.</p>

<p>Rupert and Juanita set out upon this stage
of their long journey very decently attired in
garments suitable for the exigencies of that
kind of travel, and carrying some changes
with them.</p>

<p>In New Orleans they replenished their
wardrobes, so that they presented a decidedly
fashionable and stylish appearance; sold the
wagon and mules, and took passage on a Mississippi
steamer bound for St. Louis.</p>

<p>The trip up the river seemed really restful
after the far more toilsome mode of travel
they had practised for so long. They made
some pleasant acquaintances too, and altogether
greatly enjoyed the voyage, with its return to
the usages of civilized life.</p>

<p>They stayed but a few hours in St. Louis,
then hurried on to Pleasant Plains by the
nearest and most rapid route, for Rupert was
in a fever of impatience to reach home and
the dear ones from whom he had been so long
and sadly parted.</p>

<p>Such was the story told to the assembled
family on the morning after their arrival,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
and of course it was listened to with absorbing
and often painful interest, and followed up by
many questions, now from one and now from
another.</p>

<p>It was Annis who asked, "What became
of your diamond, Ru?"</p>

<p>"Did I say positively that it was a
diamond?" he asked, in sportive tone.</p>

<p>"No, I believe not; but what did you do
with it?"</p>

<p>"Sold it, little sister; sold it for five
thousand dollars."</p>

<p>There was an exclamation of delight from
all present except Juanita, to whom the fact
was no news.</p>

<p>"Why, my good brother, you seem to
have made quite a speculation out of your
misfortune in being captured and held prisoner
so long," laughed Dr. Landreth.</p>

<p>"Yes," Rupert said, with an ardent look
of love directed to his bride. "I found a
treasure there that I could have found nowhere
else, therefore do not regret all I
have suffered. Though I would the suffering
had been mine alone," he added, with a tender
glance at his mother's worn face and a perceptible
tremble in his manly tones.</p>

<p>"Never mind, my dear boy," she said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
laying her hand affectionately upon his arm
and gazing with all a mother's love and pride
into his handsome face; "none of us need
care for them now that they are all over and
we have you safe among us once more."</p>

<p>"In fine, vigorous health too, I should say,
from your appearance," added the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, Charlie, your prescription has
worked wonders," Rupert replied, with a
happy laugh. "I never felt better in my
life."</p>

<p>"And you are quite a rich man," the
doctor went on gayly. "Your business here
has thrived and increased under my fostering
care, so that there are a few thousands in
bank to add to those you have brought with
you; and besides, the fine business ready for
you to step into again this very day if you
like."</p>

<p>"Charlie, how can I thank you!" Rupert
exclaimed with emotion, grasping the doctor's
hand with brotherly warmth.</p>

<p>"No thanks needed, Ru," returned the
doctor, laconically. "Don, my boy," wheeling
round upon him, "I don't believe one of
us has asked what success in the search for
gold you have to tell of."</p>

<p>"No," said the mother; "we were so glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
to get sight of his face that we never thought
of the gold."</p>

<p>Don gave her a loving smile. "And I,"
he said, "have been so taken up with the
happiness of being with you all again, and the
return of my brother, 'who was dead and is
alive again, was lost and is found,' that I have
not thought of it myself. I have been
moderately successful, so that I have enough
to give me a fair start in business."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad, Don," said Rupert.
"And if you shouldn't have quite enough,
you won't be too proud to take a little help
from your older brother, will you?"</p>

<p>"Or your brother-in-law?" supplemented
the doctor.</p>

<p>"Or your father?" Mr. Keith added, with
an affectionate look and smile. "I am
abundantly able, and have, perhaps, the best
right."</p>

<p>Don's face beamed with happiness.
"Thank you all," he said.</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't be too proud to accept
help from any of you, father especially; but
I hope not to need it."</p>

<p>"But, Rupert," said Wallace, inquiringly,
"I suppose you had to use a part of your five
thousand for travelling expenses?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, you needn't suppose any such
thing, my good brother," replied Rupert,
with a good-humored laugh; "the gold I
told you Juanita and I picked up was more
than sufficient for that and all other expenditures&mdash;for
clothing and so forth&mdash;in fact we
still have a few hundreds of it left."</p>

<p>"Fortunate creatures that you are!" said
Zillah. "And yet I don't think ten times
what you have would pay for that long captivity
among the Indians."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert, "I would not voluntarily
endure it again for that, or twice that;
though now that it is over I am not sorry to
have had the experience. Are you for your
share of it, love?" to Juanita, sitting by his
side.</p>

<p>"Ah, my husband," lifting to him eyes
beaming with love and happiness, "I can
never, never regret anything that brought us
together!"</p>

<p>"What beautifully correct English Juanita
speaks," remarked Mildred, admiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said Rupert, "and
take all the credit to myself, since I have
been her only teacher; she could not speak a
word of it when we first met."</p>

<p>"He first stole my heart," said Juanita,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
with a low, musical laugh, "and then it was
not so difficult to make me understand and
speak his language."</p>

<p>"No," said Rupert; "if there was any
theft it was on your side; you robbed me of
my heart with the first glance of your lovely
eyes, so that when I got possession of yours
it was only a fair exchange, which, according
to the proverb, is no robbery."</p>

<p>Juanita looked at him with pretended reproach
in her beautiful eyes. "He always
gets the better of me when we quarrel like
this; he always will have the last word."</p>

<p>"Ah, but you shouldn't let him," Zillah
said, with a merry look at her husband.
"Wallace knows better than to expect it
always. Don't you, dear?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, of course," laughed Wallace;
"but for all that I'm not apt to stop till I've
freed my mind; and sometimes my wife is
wise enough not to answer back unless with
soft words or a merry jest that conquers my
inclination to be disagreeable."</p>

<p>"She's a very nice, wise little woman,"
remarked the doctor, "yet, I think, excelled
to some extent by her elder sister," glancing
at Mildred as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Probably the possessive pronoun has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
a little to do with that opinion, Charlie,"
Mildred said, with a happy smile.</p>

<p>"Rupert," said Don, "did you never lose
your way while crossing those almost boundless
Texas prairies?"</p>

<p>"Once we did," replied Rupert, "but
finding a compass after some little search we
were able to go on in the right direction."</p>

<p>"A compass?" cried Annis; "what sort of
compass could be found out there?"</p>

<p>"It is a little plant which grows there, can
always be found, and under all circumstances,
in all kinds of weather&mdash;sunshine, rain, or
frost&mdash;invariably turns its leaves and flowers to
the north. Mr. Baird pointed it out to me, and
told me this about it before we left his ranch."</p>

<p>"What a wonderful provision of nature!"
exclaimed Wallace.</p>

<p>"How kindly God provides for all the
needs of His creatures," said Mrs. Keith.</p>

<p>Silence fell upon them for a moment. It
was broken by an exclamation from Juanita.</p>

<p>"What a happy family, my Rupert! How
many brothers and sisters, and all so kind and
loving to each other."</p>

<p>"And these are not all, my Juanita," he
said. "Ah, if only Ada and Cyril were
here!" turning to his mother as he spoke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your father has already written for
Cyril to come home to see his long-lost
brothers," she said, "but Ada we can hardly
hope to see for a year or two yet."</p>

<p>"Is she happy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Very happy in her chosen work, as well
as in her husband and two sweet children."</p>

<p>"Dear girl," he murmured, "I trust she
will have many stars in her crown of rejoicing.
You too, mother. What a good work
you have done in training her for hers."</p>

<p>"To God be all the glory," she said;
"without His blessing all my teachings would
have availed nothing. And greatly as I miss
my dear daughter, I feel that He has highly
honored me in making me the mother of a
devoted missionary of the cross.</p>

<p>"Ah, Rupert, you have had an opportunity
to do a like work for the Master while
an involuntary dweller among a heathen people."</p>

<p>She looked at him inquiringly as she
spoke.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, "and I made some effort
to improve it. I told the old, old story to all
whom I could get to listen, and sometimes I
thought their hearts were touched. I trust
the seed sown may some day spring up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
bring forth fruit, though I shall know nothing
of it till we meet before the great white throne.</p>

<p>"There was one&mdash;an old man, who was ill
a long while, dying of consumption&mdash;of whom
I have strong hope.</p>

<p>"I did what I could to relieve his physical
suffering, and he was very grateful. That
made him the more willing to listen to my
talk of the evil of sin, the danger of eternal
death, and God's appointed way of salvation.</p>

<p>"At first he heard me with apparently
perfect indifference, but after some time he
became deeply convicted of sin, and at length,
as I had reason to believe, sincerely converted.</p>

<p>"'Was it for me? for <em>me</em>? Did He die to
save <em>me</em>?' he asked again and again, the tears
falling fast from his aged eyes. 'And His
blood cleanses from all sin, <em>all sin</em>?' he repeated
over and over again. Then holding up
his hands, 'These hands are red&mdash;red with the
blood of my foes,' he said. 'I have been on
the war-path many, many times; I have taken
very many scalps; I have slain men, women,
and little children. Can His blood wash away
such stains?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I said. 'Let me read you the
very words from God's own Book;' and I did
so, for I had my Bible in my hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The blood of Jesus Christ His Son
cleanseth us from all sin. And He is mighty
to save,' I added; then read again from the
Book,</p>

<p>"'He is able also to save them to the
uttermost that come unto God by Him, seeing
He ever liveth to make intercession for them.'</p>

<p>"Then I read again from the Book, 'It is
Christ that died, yea, rather that is risen
again, who is ever at the right hand of God,
who also maketh intercession for us,' and
spoke more fully than I had before of the
resurrection, and of Christ as our Advocate
with the Father, the one Mediator between
God and man.</p>

<p>"He listened eagerly, hanging upon my
words as if he felt that the life of his soul
depended upon his full understanding of
them.</p>

<p>"And I think he did fully comprehend at
last, for such light and peace came into his
face as almost transfigured it; one could not
have believed it the face of a savage. And
the expression never changed during the few
hours that he lived.</p>

<p>"I stayed with him to the end, and it was
perfectly calm and peaceful."</p>

<p>Rupert paused, overcome by emotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
Juanita crept closer to him and put her hand
in his, while her eyes sought his face with a
look of sympathy and love.</p>

<p>He pressed the little hand fondly, giving
her a reassuring smile. Then addressing his
mother again, "I shall always feel," he said,
"that the salvation of that one soul more than
repays all I have suffered in consequence of
my capture by the Indians."</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, "it is worth more than
the sufferings we have all endured in consequence
of that, to us, dreadful event. For
they were but temporary, and that soul will
live forever."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the new member
of the family, Cousin Flora?" asked Dr.
Landreth.</p>

<p>It was the afternoon of the day succeeding
the arrival of Don, and Rupert and his wife.
Dr. Landreth had a call to the country, and
had invited Flora to drive with him.</p>

<p>They had left the town behind, and were
bowling rapidly along a smooth, level road
running through woods gorgeous in their
autumn robes of crimson and gold, russet,
green, and brown.</p>

<p>Flora had been among the listeners to
Rupert's story of his and Juanita's captivity
and subsequent wanderings, and had, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
doctor noticed at the time, furtively watched
Juanita very closely.</p>

<p>"I admire her, of course," was the reply.</p>

<p>"But why of course?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You all do; no one could help it. She
is very dark, but extremely handsome in spite
of that."</p>

<p>Rupert was at that very time asking his
mother that same question, having gone to her
room and found her there alone.</p>

<p>"I think her sweet and beautiful in appearance
and manners," Mrs. Keith answered,
smiling up at her tall son as he stood at her
side, and making room for him on the couch
where she sat. "There has not been time
for me to form any further judgment," she
continued as he accepted her invitation, taking
her hand fondly into his, "but I assure you I
am disposed to the very most favorable
opinion, both because you love her and of all
she has done for you. Perhaps but for her
faithful nursing of my wounded boy I should
never have seen his dear face again."</p>

<p>Her voice trembled with emotion as she
spoke the last words.</p>

<p>"Very likely not, dear mother," Rupert
said, supporting her with his arm. "But
setting aside the gratitude, which is certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
her due, from me at least, I am sure you will
soon learn to love her for her many very
lovable qualities."</p>

<p>"I do not doubt it, my son. And it rejoices
my heart to see how great is your
mutual love. I trust it may but increase with
years, as has your father's and mine."</p>

<p>"I hope so indeed, mother. It has always
been very evident to me that you and my
father loved each other dearly. I do not remember
ever to have heard either one address
an unkind word to the other."</p>

<p>"No," she said; "your father has been
the best of husbands to me always."</p>

<p>Then after a little pause, "Has your wife
any education, Rupert?"</p>

<p>"Not much besides what I have contrived
to give her myself in the three years we have
been together," he said. "But I have really
succeeded in giving her a good deal of general
information orally, and have taught her to
read English, using my Bible as a text-book,
and to write, using a pointed stick and the sand.</p>

<p>"I had thought of placing her in a boarding-school
for a time, but she was so distressed
at the very suggestion&mdash;declaring that it would
break her heart to be separated from me&mdash;that
I have quite given up the idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>"She is very bright, quick to catch an
idea, and more than willing to study under my
tuition, to please me, if for no other reason.</p>

<p>"And she has great musical talent. I
must get her to sing for you all this evening.
You will be delighted with her voice and her
execution."</p>

<p>"Well, my boy, I am inclined to think
she will make you happy, so far as a wife can.
She is very graceful and ladylike, and I think
you will succeed in educating her as far as
necessary for her happiness and yours. I
suppose she knows little or nothing of housewifely
accomplishments; but those too she can
learn, and you will live with us for the
present at least, I trust, if not permanently,
and if she will let me I shall gladly teach her
all I know of such matters."</p>

<p>"Dear mother, thank you," he said, his
eyes shining with pleasure; "she could not
have a more competent or kinder instructor,
and I know she will be glad to avail herself
of your kind offer, if only for my sake.</p>

<p>"She tried to learn as much as possible
from good Mrs. Baird while we were there,
and succeeded well too, I thought, in everything
she attempted."</p>

<p>On leaving his mother Rupert went in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
search of his wife. He found her alone in
the parlor, hovering over the open piano.</p>

<p>"O Rupert," she cried, looking up almost
pleadingly into his face, "do you think I may
try it? would any one be displeased?"</p>

<p>"Certainly you may try it if you wish,"
he replied, half laughing at the absurdity of
her doubt; "there is no danger of any objection
being raised; but can you play on
it?"</p>

<p>She answered only with a sportive, delighted
arch smile, seated herself at the instrument,
and dashed off into a brilliant
waltz.</p>

<p>Rupert was in raptures.</p>

<p>"Why, Juanita!" he exclaimed, as she
struck the last notes, then turned to look up
in his face with dancing eyes, "you never
told me you could play the piano."</p>

<p>"No, señor; you never asked if I could."</p>

<p>The different members of the family had
come flocking in, drawn by the music, and
wondering who the player was, for the tune
was new to them and the touch different from
that of any of themselves.</p>

<p>"Give us a song, love," requested the
delighted young husband.</p>

<p>She complied at once, and the effect upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
the small audience was fully up to Rupert's
expectation. She had a magnificent voice,
strong, full, of great compass and flexibility,
sweet and clear as the warble of a bird; a
voice that would have made her fortune as a
prima donna; nor was it entirely uncultivated.</p>

<p>How they crowded round her and poured
out their thanks and praises, begging for
another and still another till the tea-bell summoned
them away to their evening meal!</p>

<p>Juanita's playing and singing were
destined henceforth to form one of the
greatest enjoyments of the entire family.</p>

<p>Cyril came home for a short visit, and for
several weeks they all (except the doctor,
whose patients had to be attended to) gave
themselves up, for the most of the time, to the
enjoyment of each other's society. It was so
delightful to be together again after the long
separation of Rupert and Don from the
others, that they seemed unable to remain
apart for any length of time.</p>

<p>They gathered now at one of the three
houses, now at another. One day the mother
was the hostess, then Mildred, then Zillah;
but at whichever dwelling they congregated
all were perfectly at home, Juanita very soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
as much so as the rest, for they all gave her a
daughter's and sister's place, calling her by
those names, while the little ones were taught
to say, "Aunt Nita."</p>

<p>She was a trifle shy and reserved at first,
but her timidity soon melted away under the
sunshine of love that constantly shone upon
her. She grew sweetly confiding and affectionate,
not to her husband only, but to all his
relatives.</p>

<p>Influenced by an ardent desire to be and
do all he could wish, she silently took note of
all the housewifely ways of his mother and
sisters, determined to copy them as nearly as
possible when she also should become a housekeeper;
rather dreading, too, the coming of
the time when she must assume the duties of
that position, because she felt herself hardly
equal to their full performance.</p>

<p>It was several weeks after their arrival in
Pleasant Plains that one day, finding himself
alone with her, Rupert asked, "Juanita, my
love, which would you prefer, going to housekeeping,
or just living on here as we have
been doing so far, with my father and
mother?"</p>

<p>"Ah, Rupert, would they like to have us
stay?" she asked, with an eager look up into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
his face, for he was standing beside the low
chair in which she was seated.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, smiling down on her;
"and I see you would like it too."</p>

<p>"Oh no, not unless you please; I mean
I should prefer whatever would be most for
the pleasure and happiness of my dear husband."</p>

<p>"Thank you, love," he said, bending
down to caress her hair and cheek; "then we
will stay here at least for the present, for I
perceive that will be agreeable to all parties.
But whenever you weary of it, and think you
would be happier in a home of your own, you
must tell me so without reserve. Promise me
that you will."</p>

<p>"Yes, señor," she returned, gayly, "I
promise; but the time will never come till I
have learned to do all housewifely duties just
as your dear mother does."</p>

<p>Her words gave him great pleasure, and
she saw with delight that they did. She
sprang up in a pretty, impulsive way she
had, threw her arms round his neck, and gazing
up into his face with eyes beaming with
light and love, "Oh, my dear husband," she
cried, "how good, how kind you are to me
always, always!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span></p>

<p>"I should be a brute if I were anything
else to you, my precious little darling!" he
said, holding her close, with many a fond
caress.</p>

<p>Rupert was again devoting himself to
business with all the old energy and faithfulness.</p>

<p>Don, unable to decide what was best
suited to his capacity and inclination, waited
for some sort of opening, and in the mean time
resumed some of his former studies, and spent
a good deal of his leisure in the society of his
sisters and Dr. Landreth's relative and guest,
Miss Flora Weston.</p>

<p>He was pleased with her, and the liking
was mutual. Don was a handsome, high-spirited
fellow, and could be very entertaining
in conversation. And Flora, with improving
health and spirits, had become quite an
attractive girl.</p>

<p>The friendship at length ripened into love.
She remained in Pleasant Plains through the
winter, and before spring had fairly opened
the two were affianced, with the knowledge
and consent of parents and relatives on both
sides. But as both were very young, the
marriage would not take place for a year or
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p>

<p>In May Mr. Weston came for his daughter.</p>

<p>His home was in New Jersey, where he
was largely engaged in manufactures, and he
had not been long in Pleasant Plains before he
proposed that Don should take a position in
his business establishment, with the prospect
of becoming a partner at no very distant day.</p>

<p>Don thanked him heartily, took a few
days to consider the matter and consult with
parents and friends, then accepted the offer,
and again bade farewell to home and kindred;
but this time the parting was by no means so
sorrowful as on a former occasion.</p>

<p>He was not going so far away or into such
dangers, difficulties, and temptations, and
might hope to return now and then for a visit
to his childhood's home. It was but such a
separation as is common between parents and
their sons grown to man's estate.</p>

<p>Here we will leave our friends for the
present, perhaps taking up the thread of our
narrative again at some future day, and telling
what befell them in after years.</p></div>
